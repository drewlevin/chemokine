WHAT IS THE PROBLEM AND WHY IT MATTERS


The recent appearance of highly virulent strains of influenza, such as 2003 H5N1 avian and 2009 H1N1 pandemic, underscore our need discover the mechanisms that determine the pathogenicity of the numerous strains of influenza.  Unfortunately, the virulence of any given virus is determined not just by the virus' own attributes, but by a complex web of interactions between the virus and its host's immune response.  In attempting to understand what makes certain viruses more virulent in humans than others, we must strive to understand the individual interactions between the virus and the various components of the human immune system.

In this paper, we examine the immune response to infections in human bronchial tissue of three different strains of influenza: avian aH5N1, seasonal sH1N1, and pandemic pH1N1.

1. We develop the most comprehensive model to date of influenza infection in the lung, combining results from biological measurements, ODE modeling, and Agent Based Simulation
2. The model is more precise than simple ODE or DDE models because it can account for spatial effects not studied before.
3. Our model confirms results that indicate infections of aH5N1 are quickly cleared, sH1N1 is cleared (though more slowly) and pH1N1 is unable to be cleared
4. We perform sensitivity analysis on our model and find that virus dynamics dominate the course of an infection.

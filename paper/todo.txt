* Redo all experiments with the following changes:
    - Slower T cells speeds, constant between searching and climbing (6um/m?  10um/m?  double-check)
    - Stronger IgM (x10)
    - Cell radius? -> T cell 4 or 5um R, Epithelial cell R?
    - No random search, just recirculation or climb
    - Double-check recirculation times (mouse/human).


* Do a CyCells simulation of pH1N1 where infected cells skip the screting phase
  and proceed immediately to apoptosis.  See if this still allows the infection
  to persist (it likely would).


* Graph number of Tcells in circulation and in tissue vs time, add to Fig. 6
    Answer: no more random walkers...

* Experimentally determine the motility coefficient for T cells?
    Answer: D = M = e^2/4dt (e = step length, dt = timestep)

* Remove T cell speed figure from supplement?


* Mouse model

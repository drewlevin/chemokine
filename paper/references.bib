abstract = {Bronchiolar epithelial cells are the prime targets for influenza A virus infection. It still remains to be clarified which signals are generated from these cells to initiate an immune response. Among chemokines, viral infection of primary lung epithelial cells triggered exclusively the release of CXCL8/interleukin-8 (IL-8), which contrasts with our previous observation that influenza A virus induced in monocytes the expression of mononuclear-leukocyte-attracting chemokines and even suppressed the production of neutrophil-attracting chemokines. Therefore, we speculated that it may be advantageous for respiratory epithelial cells to release primarily neutrophil-attracting CXCL8/IL-8 since neutrophils rapidly remove necrotic debris and are the first line of defense against bacterial superinfections. This concept has also been supported by our finding that influenza A virus infection led to necrosis of lung epithelial cells. This is in striking contrast to previous studies where influenza A virus infection induced apoptosis in monocytes and epithelial cells from origins other than the lung. Thus, the cell type instead of the virus determines which death pathway will be followed. In addition to the release of CXCL8/IL-8, we obtained a massive release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) from virus-infected lung cells. However, whereas the CXCL8/IL-8 secretion was accompanied by induced gene activation, the transcription rate of MIF remained unchanged during the infection course and the virus-induced MIF release was predominantly a discharge from intracellular stores, suggesting that MIF is passively released upon cell death. Despite virus induced necrosis, the passively liberated MIF remained bioactive. Considering the well-established immunostimulatory effects of MIF on different leukocyte subsets, is its very likely that enhanced levels of MIF may contribute to the host immune response during the acute phase of influenza A virus infection in humans.},

abstract = {We analyzed the dynamics of an influenza A/Albany/1/98 (H3N2) viral infection, using a set of mathematical models highlighting the differences between in vivo and in vitro infection. For example, we found that including virion loss due to cell entry was critical for the in vitro model but not for the in vivo model. Experiments were performed on influenza virus-infected MDCK cells in vitro inside a hollow-fiber (HF) system, which was used to continuously deliver the drug amantadine. The HF system captures the dynamics of an influenza infection, and is a controlled environment for producing experimental data which lend themselves well to mathematical modeling. The parameter estimates obtained from fitting our mathematical models to the HF experimental data are consistent with those obtained earlier for a primary infection in a human model. We found that influenza A/Albany/1/98 (H3N2) virions under normal experimental conditions at 37 degrees C rapidly lose infectivity with a half-life of approximately 6.6+/-0.2 h, and that the lifespan of productively infected MDCK cells is approximately 13 h. Finally, using our models we estimated that the maximum efficacy of amantadine in blocking viral infection is approximately 74\%, and showed that this low maximum efficacy is likely due to the rapid development of drug resistance.},

abstract = {In the early phases of an immune response, T cells of appropriate antigen specificity become activated by antigen-presenting cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Two-photon microscopy imaging experiments have shown that this stimulation occurs in distinct stages during which T cells exhibit different motilities and interactions with dendritic cells (DCs). In this paper, we utilize the Cellular Potts Model, a model formalism that takes cell shapes and cellular interactions explicitly into account, to simulate the dynamics of, and interactions between, T cells and DCs in the lymph node paracortex. Our three-dimensional simulations suggest that the initial decrease in T-cell motility after antigen appearance is due to "stop signals" transmitted by activated DCs to T cells. The long-lived interactions that occur at a later stage can only be explained by the presence of both stop signals and a high adhesion between specific T cells and antigen-bearing DCs. Furthermore, our results indicate that long-lasting contacts with T cells are promoted when DCs retract dendrites that detect a specific contact at lower velocities than other dendrites. Finally, by performing long simulations (after prior fitting to short time scale data) we are able to provide an estimate of the average contact duration between T cells and DCs.},

abstract = {Infection of cells with influenza A virus results in cell death with apoptotic characteristics. Apoptosis is regarded as a non-inflammatory process. However, during influenza an inflammatory response occurs in the airway epithelium. An examination of this apparent paradox was made using influenza A virus infection of human nasal and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Some cytokine genes (IL-18, CCL2 and CCL5) were expressed constitutively in nasal cells but no cytokine was released. In bronchiolar cells, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and CXCL8 expression was constitutive, whilst CCL2 and CCL5 expression was upregulated following influenza virus infection. IL-6, CXCL8 and CCL5 were released but IL-1 beta and CCL2 were not. In bronchiolar cells, cell death was inhibited by the caspase-8 (Z-IETD-fmk) and pan-caspase (Z-VAD-fmk) inhibitors and these inhibitors enhanced expression of CCL5 and increased the levels of the three secreted cytokines significantly. Thus, the amount of each cytokine released from bronchiolar cells is reduced during cell death, implying that the observed inflammatory response in influenza would be greater if cell death did not occur. Reduced cytokine release is also associated with fragmentation of the Golgi body, as the caspase inhibitors also rescued influenza A virus-induced fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon.},

A geometric mesh of the capillary network over the surface of a single alveolar sac is created using a Voronoi meshing technique. A pressure-flow relationship that describes blood cell transit is implemented in the network. Regional flow is investigated by imposing gravity-dependent transpulmonary and transmural boundary conditions. Comparisons of red and white blood cell transit times in the upper, mid, and lower lung showed physiologically consistent trends of a decreasing average transit time and an increased homogeneity of transit time distributions as a result of increasing average capillary diameter and flow down the height of a vertical lung. The model was found to reproduce experimentally consistent trends in red blood cell transit times and relative blood flows with respect to lung height. This model enables flow properties and cell transit time behavior in the pulmonary microcirculation under varying conditions, for example in different "zones" of the lung, to be explored.},

abstract = {Background: Fatal human respiratory disease associated with influenza A subtype H5N1 has been documented in Hong Kong, and more recently in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. We previously demonstrated that patients with H5N1 disease had unusually high serum levels of IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10). Furthermore, when compared with human influenza virus subtype H1N1, the H5N1 viruses in 1997 (A/Hong Kong/483/97) (H5N1/97) were more potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-a) and chemokines (e.g. IP-10) from primary human macrophages in vitro, which suggests that cytokines dysregulation may play a role in pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. Since respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target cell for replication of influenza viruses, it is pertinent to investigate the cytokine induction profile of H5N1 viruses in these cells. Methods: We used quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA to compare the profile of cytokine and chemokine gene expression induced by H5N1 viruses A/HK/483/97 (H5N1/97), A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04 (both H5N1/04) with that of human H1N1 virus in human primary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Results: We demonstrated that in comparison to human H1N1 viruses, H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses were more potent inducers of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in primary human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Recent H5N1 viruses from Vietnam (H5N1/04) appeared to be even more potent at inducing IP-10 than H5N1/97 virus. Conclusion: The H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human respiratory epithelial cells than subtype H1N1 virus. We suggest that this hyper-induction of cytokines may be relevant to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease.},

abstract = {Influenza H5N1 virus continues to be enzootic in poultry and transmits zoonotically to humans. Although a swine-origin H1N1 virus has emerged to become pandemic, its virulence for humans remains modest in comparison to that seen in zoonotic H5N1 disease. As human respiratory epithelium is the primary target cells for influenza viruses, elucidating the viral tropism and host innate immune responses of influenza H5N1 virus in human bronchial epithelium may help to understand the pathogenesis. Here we established primary culture of undifferentiated and well differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and infected with highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 virus (A/Vietnam/3046/2004) and a seasonal influenza H1N1 virus (A/Hong Kong/54/1998), the viral replication kinetics and cytokine and chemokine responses were compared by qPCR and ELISA. We found that the in vitro culture of the well differentiated NHBE cells acquired the physiological properties of normal human bronchi tissue which express high level of $\alpha$2-6-linked sialic acid receptors and human airway trypsin-like (HAT) protease, in contrast to the low expression in the non-differentiated NHBE cells. When compared to H1N1 virus, the H5N1 virus replicated more efficiently and induced a stronger type I interferon response in the undifferentiated NHBE cells. In contrast, in well differentiated cultures, H5N1 virus replication was less efficient and elicited a lower interferon-beta response in comparison with H1N1 virus. Our data suggest that the differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells has a major influence in cells' permissiveness to human H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses and the host innate immune responses. The reduced virus replication efficiency partially accounts for the lower interferon-beta responses in influenza H5N1 virus infected well differentiated NHBE cells. Since influenza infection in the bronchial epithelium will lead to tissue damage and associate with the epithelium regeneration, the data generated from the undifferentiated NHBE cultures may also be relevant to disease pathogenesis.},

CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 are both expressed on activated macrophages and T cells. We examined how the absence of these chemokine receptors would affect pulmonary chemokine expression and induced leukocyte recruitment by infecting CCR5-deficient mice and CCR2-deficient mice with a mouse-adapted strain of influenza A virus. CCR5(-/-) mice displayed increased mortality rates associated with acute, severe pneumonitis, whereas CCR2(-/-) mice were protected from the early pathological manifestations of influenza because of defective macrophage recruitment. This delay in macrophage accumulation in CCR2(-/-) mice caused a subsequent delay in T cell migration, which correlated with high pulmonary viral titers at early time points. Infected CCR5(-/-) mice and CCR2(-/-) mice both exhibited increased expression of the gene for MCP-1, the major ligand for CCR2(-/-) and a key regulator of induced macrophage migration. These studies illustrate the very different roles that CCR5 and CCR2 play in the macrophage response to influenza infection and demonstrate how defects in macrophage recruitment affect the normal development of the cell-mediated immune response.},

We employ the extended Gett and Hodgkin Nat.

The same data is also fitted with a simple mathematical model that we derived by reformulating the numerical model of Deenick et al. J. Immunol. 170:4963-4972, 2003. By a non-linear fitting procedure we estimate parameter values and confidence intervals to identify the parameters that are influenced by the IL-2 concentration. We obtain a significantly better fit to the data when we assume that the T cell death rate depends on the number of divisions cells have completed. We provide an outlook on future work that involves extending the Deenick et al. J.

abstract = {Avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses cause severe disease in humans, but the basis for their virulence remains unclear. In vitro and animal studies indicate that high and disseminated viral replication is important for disease pathogenesis. Laboratory experiments suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation may contribute to disease severity. To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood.

abstract = {Avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses cause severe disease in humans, but the basis for their virulence remains unclear. In vitro and animal studies indicate that high and disseminated viral replication is important for disease pathogenesis. Laboratory experiments suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation may contribute to disease severity. To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood. Viral RNA in blood was present only in fatal H5N1 cases and was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. We observed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with pharyngeal viral loads.

abstract = {We have shown that the intensity of expression of the C-C chemokine receptor CCR5 at the single CD4(+) cell level strongly determines the efficiency of its function as a coreceptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1. By analogy, we examined if the number of CCR5 molecules at the cell surface might determine its chemotactic response to CCR5 ligands. To test this hypothesis, we measured by flow cytometry the migration of primary human T cells towards the CCR5-binding chemokine CCL5 in vitro. First, we observed a dose-dependent blockage of this migration exerted by an anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody. Second, we sorted peripheral blood mononuclear cells into five subpopulations expressing various cell surface CCR5 densities, and observed a correlation between the intensity of migration towards CCL5 and the level of CCR5 expression on these subpopulations. Third, we transduced CCR5(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the CCR5 gene, and observed that the CCR5 over-expression induced an over-migration towards CCL5. Finally, we observed in healthy donors a correlation between the chemotactic response of peripheral blood CD8(+) T cell to CCL5 and their level of surface CCR5 expression. T-cell surface CCR5 density, which is constant over time for a given individual, but varies drastically among individuals, might therefore be an important personal determinant of T-cell migration in many biological situations where CCR5-binding chemokines play a role, such as graft rejection, T helper 1-mediated auto-immune diseases, and infectious diseases involving CCR5. Moreover, our data highlight the therapeutic potential of CCR5 antagonists in these situations.},

abstract = {IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10, CXCL10), a chemokine secreted from cells stimulated with type I and II IFNs and LPS, is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. Expression of IP-10 is seen in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells into sites of tissue inflammation. To determine the in vivo function of IP-10, we constructed an IP-10-deficient mouse (IP-10(-/-)) by targeted gene disruption. Immunological analysis revealed that IP-10(-/-) mice had impaired T cell responses. T cell proliferation to allogeneic and antigenic stimulation and IFN-gamma secretion in response to antigenic challenge were impaired in IP-10(-/-) mice. In addition, IP-10(-/-) mice exhibited an impaired contact hypersensitivity response, characterized by decreased ear swelling and reduced inflammatory cell infiltrates. T cells recovered from draining lymph nodes also had a decreased proliferative response to Ag restimulation. Furthermore, IP-10(-/-) mice infected with a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus had an impaired ability to control viral replication in the brain. This was associated with decreased recruitment of CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes into the brain, reduced levels of IFN-gamma and the IFN-gamma-induced chemokines monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig, CXCL9) and IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC, CXCL11) in the brain, decreased numbers of virus-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD8(+) cells in the spleen, and reduced levels of demyelination in the CNS. Taken together, our data suggest a role for IP-10 in both effector T cell generation and trafficking in vivo.},

We find that the killing of targets follows the law of mass-action, i.e., the death rate of individual target cells remains proportional to the frequency (or the total number) of specific CD8 T cells in the spleen despite the fact that effector cell densities and effector to target ratios vary about a 1000-fold. The killing rate of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells is largely independent of T cell specificity and differentiation stage. Our results thus allow one to calculate the critical T cell concentration at which growth of a virus with a given replication rate can be prevented from the start of infection by memory CD8 T cell response.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in immunology, several key parameters determining virus dynamics in infected hosts remain largely unknown. For example, the rate at which specific effector and memory CD8 T cells clear virus-infected cells in vivo is hardly known for any viral infection. We propose a framework to quantify T-cell-mediated killing of infected or peptide-pulsed target cells using the widely used in vivo cytotoxicity assay. We have reanalyzed recently published data on killing of peptide-pulsed splenocytes by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and memory CD8 T cells specific to NP396 and GP276 epitopes of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in the mouse spleen. Because there are so many effector CD8 T cells in spleens of mice at the peak of the immune response, NP396- and GP276-pulsed targets are estimated to have very short half-lives of 2 and 14 min, respectively. After the effector numbers have diminished, i.e., in LCMV-immune mice, the half-lives become 48 min and 2.8 h for NP396- and GP276-expressing targets, respectively. Analysis of several alternative models demonstrates that the estimates of half-life times of peptide-pulsed targets are not affected when changes are made in the model assumptions. Our report provides a unifying framework to compare killing efficacies of CD8 T-cell responses specific to different viral and bacterial infections in vivo, which may be used to compare efficacies of various cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-based vaccines.},

abstract = {Understanding immunodominance, the phenomenon of epitope-specific T cells expanding in an often distinctly hierarchical fashion, is important for the design of T-cell-based intervention strategies. Several recent studies have investigated immunodominance of H-2Db-restricted CD8+ T cells specific for the nucleoprotein NP366 and acid polymerase PA224 epitopes during influenza A virus infection of C57BL/6 mice. CD8+ T cells specific for these two epitopes are codominant during primary infection; NP366 dominates during secondary infection. While a number of explanations for this observation have been proposed, none of them can fully account for all the observed data. In this article, we use a simple mathematical model to explain the seemingly inconsistent data. We show that the dynamic interactions between CD8+ T cells and antigen presentation lead to a situation where CD8+ T cells are limiting during the initial response whereas antigen is limiting in the secondary response. This numbers game between antigen and CD8+ T cells can reproduce the observed immunodominance of the NP336- and PA224-specific CD8+ T cells, thereby explaining the reported experimental data.},

abstract = {Since the first recorded infection of humans with H5N1 viruses of avian origin in 1997, sporadic human infections continue to occur with a staggering mortality rate of >60\%. Although sustained human-to-human transmission has not occurred yet, there is a growing concern that these H5N1 viruses might acquire this trait and raise the specter of a pandemic. Despite progress in deciphering viral determinants of pathogenicity, we still lack crucial information on virus/immune system interactions pertaining to severe disease and high mortality associated with human H5N1 influenza virus infections. Using two human isolates of H5N1 viruses that differ in their pathogenicity in mice, we have defined mechanistic links among the rate of viral replication, mortality, CD8 T cell responses, and immunopathology. The extreme pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses was directly linked to the ability of the virus to replicate rapidly, and swiftly attain high steady-state titers in the lungs within 48 hours after infection. The remarkably high replication rate of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus did not prevent the induction of IFN-$\beta$ or activation of CD8 T cells, but the CD8 T cell response was ineffective in controlling viral replication in the lungs and CD8 T cell deficiency did not affect viral titers or mortality. Additionally, BIM deficiency ameliorated lung pathology and inhibited T cell apoptosis without affecting survival of mice. Therefore, rapidly replicating, highly lethal H5N1 viruses could simply outpace and overwhelm the adaptive immune responses, and kill the host by direct cytopathic effects. However, therapeutic suppression of early viral replication and the associated enhancement of CD8 T cell responses improved the survival of mice following a lethal H5N1 infection. These findings suggest that suppression of early H5N1 virus replication is key to the programming of an effective host response, which has implications in treatment of this infection in humans.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus infection induces massive inflammation and lung damage. Activation of CD8 T cells by dendritic cells (DCs) is necessary to control disease. We undertook studies to track directly Ag presentation to CD8 T cells in vivo through the first 72 h after infection with OVA-expressing influenza A virus. We found that Ag presentation by DCs occurs strictly in the draining lymph nodes and not within the lung itself. Surprisingly, Ag presentation was found to be mediated by a CD11b(+) DC population. Finally, the expression of antigenic complexes on DCs correlated with the location and timing of CD8 T cell activation. These results have implications for approaches to control influenza A virus infection.},

abstract = {Although memory B cells (BMem) contribute significantly to resistance to infection, BMem population characteristics that may relate to protective efficacy have received little attention. Here, we report a comprehensive quantitative analysis of virus-specific IgG and IgA BMem dispersion after transient influenza pneumonia in mice. From early in the response, BMem circulated continuously and dispersed widely to secondary lymphoid tissues. However, a complicated picture emerged with BMem frequency differences between secondary lymphoid tissues indicating an influence of local tissue factors on trafficking. BMem numbers increased and stabilized at tissue-specific frequencies without contraction of the BMem pool during the period of analysis. The lung was notable as a nonsecondary lymphoid tissue where a rapid influx of IgG and IgA BMem established relatively high frequencies that were maintained long term. Our findings provide insights into the pattern of BMem dispersion, and emphasize the lung as a complex repository of immune memory after local infection.},

Influenza A virus-infected respiratory epithelial cells produce limited amounts of chemokines (RANTES, MCP-1, IL-8) and IFN-alpha/beta, whereas monocytes/macrophages readily produce chemokines such as RANTES, MIP-1alpha, MCP-1, MCP-3, IP-10 and cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-18 and IFN-alpha/beta.

The molecular and cellular factors responsible for virus-induced lymphoid remodeling are not well known to date. Here we applied optical projection tomography, a mesoscopic imaging technique, for a global analysis of the entire 3-dimensional structure of mouse peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs), focusing on B-cell areas and high endothelial venule (HEV) networks. Structural homeostasis of PLNs was characterized by a strict correlation between total PLN volume, B-cell volume, B-cell follicle number, and HEV length. After infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, we observed a substantial, lymphotoxin (LT) beta-receptor-dependent reorganization of the PLN microarchitecture, in which an initial B-cell influx was followed by 3-fold increases in PLN volume and HEV network length on day 8 after infection. Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that virus-induced PLN and HEV network remodeling required LTalpha(1)beta(2)-expressing B cells, whereas the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor-A signaling pathways had no significant effect on PLN expansion. In summary, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-induced PLN growth depends on a vascular endothelial growth factor-A-independent, LT- and B cell-dependent morphogenic pathway, as revealed by an in-depth mesoscopic analysis of the global PLN structure.},

abstract = {The cellular immune response to primary influenza virus infection is complex, involving multiple cell types and anatomical compartments, and is difficult to measure directly. Here we develop a two-compartment model that quantifies the interplay between viral replication and adaptive immunity. The fidelity of the model is demonstrated by accurately confirming the role of CD4 help for antibody persistence and the consequences of immune depletion experiments. The model predicts that drugs to limit viral infection and/or production must be administered within 2 days of infection, with a benefit of combination therapy when administered early, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells in the lung are as effective for viral clearance as neutralizing antibodies when present at the time of challenge. The model can be used to investigate explicit biological scenarios and generate experimentally testable hypotheses. For example, when the adaptive response depends on cellular immune cell priming, regulation of antigen presentation has greater influence on the kinetics of viral clearance than the efficiency of virus neutralization or cellular cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that the modulation of antigen presentation or the number of lung resident cytotoxic cells and the combination drug intervention are strategies to combat highly virulent influenza viruses. We further compared alternative model structures, for example, B-cell activation directly by the virus versus that through professional antigen-presenting cells or dendritic cell licensing of CD8 T cells.},

Here we describe a device microfabricated by soft lithography and consisting of a network of microfluidic channels that can generate spatially and temporally controlled gradients of chemotactic factors. When human neutrophils are positioned within a microchannel, their migration in simple and complex interleukin-8 (IL-8) gradients can be tested. The cells exhibit strong directional migration toward increasing concentrations of IL-8 in linear gradients. Neutrophil migration halts abruptly when cells encounter a sudden drop in the chemoattractant concentration to zero ("cliff" gradient). When neutrophils are challenged with a gradual increase and decrease in chemoattractant ("hill" gradient), however, the cells traverse the crest of maximum concentration and migrate further before reversing direction. The technique described in this paper provides a robust method to investigate migratory cells under a variety of conditions not accessible to study by earlier techniques.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Influenza A viruses of avian origin represent an emerging threat to human health as the progenitors of the next influenza pandemic. In recent years, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses have caused unprecedented epizootics on three continents and rare but highly fatal disease among humans exposed to diseased birds. Avian viruses of the H7 and H9 subtypes have also infected humans but generally resulted in far milder disease, yet they too should be considered as possible pandemic threats. Influenza virus infection elicits a complex network of host immune responses that, in uncomplicated influenza, results in effective control of the virus and the development of long-term memory responses. However, fatal avian H5N1 virus infection in both humans and experimental mammalian models is characterized by a high viral load in the respiratory tract, peripheral leukopenia and lymphopenia, a massive infiltration of macrophages into the lung, and dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine responses. This review focuses on avian influenza viruses as a pandemic threat, their induction of host innate immune responses in mammalian species, and the contribution of these responses to the disease process.},

abstract = {The CD8+ T cell diaspora has been analyzed after secondary challenge with an influenza A virus that replicates only in the respiratory tract. Numbers of DbNP366- and DbPA224-specific CD8+ T cells were measured by tetramer staining at the end of the recall response, then followed sequentially in the lung, lymph nodes, spleen, blood, and other organs. The extent of clonal expansion did not reflect the sizes of the preexisting memory T cell pools. Although the high-frequency CD8+ tetramer+ populations in the pneumonic lung and mediastinal lymph nodes fell rapidly from peak values, the whole mouse virus-specific CD8+ T cell counts decreased only 2-fold over the 4 weeks after infection, then subsided at a fairly steady rate to reach a plateau at about 2 months. The largest numbers were found throughout in the spleen, then the bone marrow. The CD8+DbNP366 + and CD8+DbPA224 + sets remained significantly enlarged for at least 4 months, declining at equivalent rates while retaining the nucleoprotein > acid polymerase immunodominance hierarchy characteristic of the earlier antigen-driven phase. Lowest levels of the CD69 activation marker were detected consistently on virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the blood, then the spleen. Those in the bone marrow and liver were intermediate, and CD69hi T cells were very prominent in the regional lymph nodes and the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue. Any population of resting CD8+ memory T cells is thus phenotypically heterogeneous, widely dispersed, and subject to broad homeostatic and local environmental effects irrespective of epitope specificity or magnitude.},

abstract = {Bronchial epithelial cells are primary sites of airway viral infection, and these cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases. It has recently been reported that bronchial epithelial cells express RANTES. RANTES attracts monocytes, T cells, eosinophils, and basophils; it can also activate eosinophils. To determine whether viral infection induces RANTES expression on bronchial epithelial cells, we infected a bronchial epithelial cell line, NCI-H292, with influenza virus A (H3N2). We then examined the concentration of RANTES in the culture medium of infected cells by ELISA and assessed expression of the gene for RANTES by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We also investigated the concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the medium of infected cells, because some virus infections have been reported to induce expression of these cytokines on bronchial epithelial cells, but there are few data concerning influenza virus infection. Small amounts of IL-6 and IL-8 were detected in the medium of uninfected cells. RANTES was not detected in the medium of uninfected cells. After influenza virus infection, significant amounts of IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES were released into the culture medium of infected cells, and RANTES messenger RNA was detected from infected cells. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was not detected in the medium of uninfected and infected cells. These results suggest that influenza virus infection may stimulate production of IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES from human bronchial epithelial cells and that these cytokines may contribute to the pathogenesis of airway inflammatory diseases caused by influenza virus infection.},

abstract = {Neutrophils are recruited from the blood to sites of sterile inflammation, where they contribute to wound healing but may also cause tissue damage. By using spinning disk confocal intravital microscopy, we examined the kinetics and molecular mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment to sites of focal hepatic necrosis in vivo. Adenosine triphosphate released from necrotic cells activated the Nlrp3 inflammasome to generate an inflammatory microenvironment that alerted circulating neutrophils to adhere within liver sinusoids. Subsequently, generation of an intravascular chemokine gradient directed neutrophil migration through healthy tissue toward foci of damage. Lastly, formyl-peptide signals released from necrotic cells guided neutrophils through nonperfused sinusoids into the injury. Thus, dynamic in vivo imaging revealed a multistep hierarchy of directional cues that guide neutrophil localization to sites of sterile inflammation.},

abstract = {Seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) continues to be a public health threat. However, we lack a detailed and quantitative understanding of the immune response kinetics to IAV infection and which biological parameters most strongly influence infection outcomes. To address these issues, we use modeling approaches combined with experimental data to quantitatively investigate the innate and adaptive immune responses to primary IAV infection. Mathematical models were developed to describe the dynamic interactions between target (epithelial) cells, influenza virus, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and virus-specific IgG and IgM. IAV and immune kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting models to a large data set obtained from primary H3N2 IAV infection of 340 mice. Prior to a detectable virus-specific immune response (before day 5), the estimated half-life of infected epithelial cells is 1.2 days, and the half-life of free infectious IAV is 4 h. During the adaptive immune response (after day 5), the average half-life of infected epithelial cells is 0.5 days, and the average half-life of free infectious virus is 1.8 min. During the adaptive phase, model fitting confirms that CD8+ CTLs are crucial for limiting infected cells, while virus-specific IgM regulates free IAV levels. This may imply that CD4 T cells and class-switched IgG antibodies are more relevant for generating IAV-specific memory and preventing future infection via a more rapid secondary immune response. Also, simulation studies were performed to understand the relative contributions of biological parameters to IAV clearance. This study provides a basis to better understand and predict influenza virus immunity.},

abstract = {The recirculation of T cells between the blood and secondary lymphoid organs requires that T cells are motile and sensitive to tissue-specific signals. T cell motility has been studied in vitro, but the migratory behavior of individual T cells in vivo has remained enigmatic. Here, using intravital two-photon laser microscopy, we imaged the locomotion and trafficking of naive CD4(+) T cells in the inguinal lymph nodes of anesthetized mice. Intravital recordings deep within the lymph node showed T cells flowing rapidly in the microvasculature and captured individual homing events. Within the diffuse cortex, T cells displayed robust motility with an average velocity of approximately 11 microm x min(-1). T cells cycled between states of low and high motility roughly every 2 min, achieving peak velocities >25 microm x min(-1). An analysis of T cell migration in 3D space revealed a default trafficking program analogous to a random walk. Our results show that naive T cells do not migrate collectively, as they might under the direction of pervasive chemokine gradients. Instead, they appear to migrate as autonomous agents, each cell taking an independent trafficking path. Our results call into question the role of chemokine gradients for basal T cell trafficking within T cell areas and suggest that antigen detection may result from a stochastic process through which a random walk facilitates contact with antigen-presenting dendritic cells.},

Here we show that mice lacking spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches generate unexpectedly robust primary B- and T-cell responses to influenza, which seem to be initiated at sites of induced BALT (iBALT). Areas of iBALT have distinct B-cell follicles and T-cell areas, and support T and B-cell proliferation. The homeostatic chemokines CXCL13 and CCL21 are expressed independently of TNFalpha and lymphotoxin at sites of iBALT formation. In addition, mice with iBALT, but lacking peripheral lymphoid organs, clear influenza infection and survive higher doses of virus than do normal mice, indicating that immune responses generated in iBALT are not only protective, but potentially less pathologic, than systemic immune responses. Thus, iBALT functions as an inducible secondary lymphoid tissue for respiratory immune responses.},

abstract = {Challenge of the immune system with bacterial superantigens or endotoxin induces the systemic release of cytokines followed by lethal septic shock. The lung is particularly susceptible to systemic toxin exposure resulting in acute leucocyte infiltration and vascular damage. In the present study, the functions of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) for chemokine regulation during acute lung inflammation were examined. Following administration of the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), lung mRNA levels of the chemokines cytokine-induced neutrophil chemo-attractant (KC), lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine (LIX), macrophage chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-2 were increased to a similar extent both in controls and in mice deficient for the IFN-gamma or 55 000 MW TNF receptors. In contrast, interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig) mRNA expression was markedly reduced in mice deficient for IFN-gamma or IFN-gamma receptor, but not in 55 000 MW TNF receptor knockout mice. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that IP-10 was highly expressed in lung interstitial macrophages of C57BL/6, but not of IFN-gamma receptor-deficient mice. In contrast to SEB administration, treatment with lipopolysaccharide resulted in a strong induction of IP-10 and Mig in IFN-gamma receptor-deficient mice. Together, these results establish a critical function of IFN-gamma for chemokine induction in acute lung inflammation that is dependent on the nature of the inflammatory stimulus.},

abstract = {In less than 3 months after the first cases of swine origin 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus infections were reported from Mexico, WHO declared a pandemic. The pandemic virus is antigenically distinct from seasonal influenza viruses, and the majority of human population lacks immunity against this virus. We have studied the activation of innate immune responses in pandemic virus-infected human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages. Pandemic A/Finland/553/2009 virus, representing a typical North American/European lineage virus, replicated very well in these cells. The pandemic virus, as well as the seasonal A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) viruses, induced type I (alpha/beta interferon IFN-alpha/beta) and type III (IFN-lambda1 to -lambda3) IFN, CXCL10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression weakly in DCs. Mouse-adapted A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and human A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) viruses, instead, induced efficiently the expression of antiviral and proinflammatory genes. Both IFN-alpha and IFN-beta inhibited the replication of the pandemic (H1N1) virus. The potential of IFN-lambda3 to inhibit viral replication was lower than that of type I IFNs. However, the pandemic virus was more sensitive to the antiviral IFN-lambda3 than the seasonal A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1) virus. The present study demonstrates that the novel pandemic (H1N1) influenza A virus can readily replicate in human primary DCs and macrophages and efficiently avoid the activation of innate antiviral responses. It is, however, highly sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFNs, which may provide us an additional means to treat severe cases of infection especially if significant drug resistance emerges.},

abstract = {It is generally recognized that larger animals eat more, live longer, have larger offspring, and so on; but it is unusual to see these commonplace observations as a basis for scientific biology. A large number of empirically based relationships describe biological rates as simple functions of body size; and other such relations predict the intrinsic rate of population growth, animal speed, animal density, territory size, prey size, physiology, and morphology. Such equations almost always exist for mammals and birds, often for other vertebrates and invertebrates, sometimes for protozoa, algae, and bacteria, and occasionally even for plants. There are too many organisms to measure all aspects of the biology of every species of population, so scientists must depend on generalizations. Body size relations represent our most extensive and powerful assemblage of generalizations, but they have never been organized for use in ecology. This book represents the largest single compilation of interspecific size relations, and instructs the reader on the use of these relationships; their comparison, combination, and criticism. Both strengths and weaknesses of our current knowledge are discussed in order to indicate the many possible directions for further research. This important volume will therefore provide a point of departure toward a new applied ecology, giving quantitative solutions to real questions. It will interest advanced students of ecology and comparative physiology as well as professional biologists.},

This new appreciation of T(RM) that reside in epithelial tissues and mediate host defense has been studied most extensively in skin: adult human skin contains large numbers of functional T(RM) that express skin specific markers. Indeed, more than twice as many T cells reside in skin as in peripheral blood. This T cell population has a diverse T cell receptor repertoire, and can produce a broad array of cytokines. More recently, we have begun to examine other epithelial tissues for the presence of resident T cells. In the present study, we asked whether analogous populations of resident T cells could be found in human lung. We were able to demonstrate abundant resident T cells in human lung-more than 10 billion T cells were present. Lung T cells were largely of the effector memory T cell (T(EM)) phenotype, though small numbers of central memory T cells (T(CM)) and T regulatory cells (T(reg)) could be identified. Lung T cells had a diverse T cell receptor repertoire and subsets produced IL-17, IL-4, IFN$\gamma$, as well as TNF$\alpha$. A significant number of lung T(RM) CD4+Th cells produced more than one cytokine, identifying them as "multifunctional" Th1 type cells. Finally, lung T(RM), but not T(RM) resident to skin or T cells from blood, proliferated in response to influenza virus. This work suggests that normal human lung contains large numbers of T(RM) cells, and these cells are poised to respond to recall antigens previously encountered through lung mucosa. This population of T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and other T cell mediated lung diseases.},

abstract = {A key question in pandemic influenza is the relative roles of innate immunity and target cell depletion in limiting primary infection and modulating pathology. Here, we model these interactions using detailed data from equine influenza virus infection, combining viral and immune (type I interferon) kinetics with estimates of cell depletion. The resulting dynamics indicate a powerful role for innate immunity in controlling the rapid peak in virus shedding. As a corollary, cells are much less depleted than suggested by a model of human influenza based only on virus-shedding data. We then explore how differences in the influence of viral proteins on interferon kinetics can account for the observed spectrum of virus shedding, immune response, and influenza pathology. In particular, induction of high levels of interferon ("cytokine storms"), coupled with evasion of its effects, could lead to severe pathology, as hypothesized for some fatal cases of influenza.},

Our studies have focused on the regulation of chemokine receptors in dendritic cells (DC) and T lymphocytes. Chemokine receptors expressed by immature DC promote their migration to inflamed tissues, where antigens are captured and maturation is induced. Maturing DC upregulate CCR7, which drives their migration to the T-cell areas of the draining lymph nodes where antigen is presented to na\"{\i}ve T cells. DC produce a variety of chemokines that influence DC recruitment into inflamed tissues and DC-T-cell interaction in the lymph nodes. Chemokine receptors are differentially acquired by developing Th1 and Th2 cells and are differentially expressed on subsets of "central memory" and "effector memory" T cells. Furthermore, following antigenic stimulation, effector T cells can rapidly switch chemokine receptor expression, acquiring new migratory capacities. These studies provide insights into the mechanisms that control T-cell priming as well as memory and effector immune responses.},

While viral dynamic models are typically nonlinear with analytical solutions difficult to obtain, the exponential nature of the solutions suggests approximations can be found. We derive a two-phase approximate solution to the target cell limited influenza model and illustrate its accuracy using data and previously established parameter values of six patients infected with influenza A. For one patient, the fall in virus concentration from its peak was not consistent with our predictions during the decay phase and an alternate approximation is derived. We find expressions for the rate and length of initial viral growth in terms of model parameters, the extent each parameter is involved in viral peaks, and the single parameter responsible for virus decay. We discuss applications of this analysis in antiviral treatments and in investigating host and virus heterogeneities.},

abstract = {Background: One of the goals of computational immunology is to facilitate the study of infectious diseases. Dynamic modeling is a powerful tool to integrate empirical data from independent sources, make novel predictions, and to foresee the gaps in the current knowledge. Dynamic models constructed to study the interactions between pathogens and hosts' immune responses have revealed key regulatory processes in the infection. Optimum complexity and dynamic modeling: We discuss the usability of various deterministic dynamic modeling approaches to study the progression of infectious diseases. The complexity of these models is dependent on the number of components and the temporal resolution in the model. We comment on the specific use of simple and complex models in the study of the progression of infectious diseases. Conclusions: Models of sub-systems or simplified immune response can be used to hypothesize phenomena of host-pathogen interactions and to estimate rates and parameters. Nevertheless, to study the pathogenesis of an infection we need to develop models describing the dynamics of the immune components involved in the progression of the disease. Incorporation of the large number and variety of immune processes involved in pathogenesis requires tradeoffs in modeling.},

We reassessed homeostasis and dynamics of T cells 1) by generating a mathematical model describing the spatiotemporal features of T cell differentiation, and 2) by fitting this model to experimental data generated by disturbing T cell differentiation through transient depletion of dividing T cells in mice. This specific depletion was obtained by administration of ganciclovir to mice expressing the conditional thymidine kinase suicide gene in T cells. With this experimental approach, we could derive quantitative parameters describing the cell fluxes, residence times, and rates of import, export, proliferation, and death across cell compartments for thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants (RTEs). Among other parameters, we show that 93\% of thymocytes produced before single-positive stages are eliminated through the selection process. Then, a postselection peripheral expansion of naive T cells contributes three times more to naive T cell production than the thymus, with half of the naive T cells consisting of dividing RTEs. Altogether, this work provides a quantitative population dynamical framework of thymocyte development, RTEs, and naive T cells.},

As a consequence, recall is thought to result from a phased response first involving those T cells already at the site of infection followed by the infiltration of memory cells from the wider circulation. We have recently reported that tissue-resident T cells can undergo stimulation and proliferation in response to local infection. In this study, we examine the proliferation of memory T cells newly recruited from the circulation. Our results show that although recruitment of circulating memory cells is nonspecific in nature, there is preferential proliferation of specific T cells within infected tissues. Thus, expansion represents a means of local Ag-specific enrichment of T cells recruited from a circulating memory pool of mixed specificities.},

Mechanistic and semimechanistic ordinary differential equations were developed to describe the expansion, trafficking, and disappearance of activated virus-specific CD8(+) T cells in lymph nodes, spleens, and lungs of mice during primary influenza A infection. An intensive sampling of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells from these three compartments was used to inform the models. Rigorous statistical fitting of the models to the experimental data allowed estimation of important biological parameters. Although the draining lymph node is the first tissue in which Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells are detected, it was found that the spleen contributes the greatest number of effector CD8(+) T cells to the lung, with rates of expansion and migration that exceeded those of the draining lymph node. In addition, models that were based on the number and kinetics of professional APCs fit the data better than those based on viral load, suggesting that the immune response is limited by Ag presentation rather than the amount of virus. Modeling also suggests that loss of effector T cells from the lung is significant and time dependent, increasing toward the end of the acute response. Together, these efforts provide a better understanding of the primary CD8(+) T cell response to influenza infection, changing the view that the spleen plays a minor role in the primary immune response.},

To better understand the mechanism(s) of H5N1 virus pathogenesis and host responses in humans, we utilized a polarized human bronchial epithelial cell model that expresses both avian alpha-2,3- and human alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors on the apical surface and supports productive replication of both H5N1 and H3N2 viruses. Using this model, we compared the abilities of selected 2004 HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from humans and a recent human H3N2 virus to trigger the type I interferon (IFN) response. H5N1 viruses elicited significantly less IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) nuclear translocation, as well as delayed and reduced production of IFN-beta compared with the H3N2 virus. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Stat2 and induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as MX1, ISG15, IRF7, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I, were substantially delayed and reduced in cells infected with H5N1 viruses. We also observed that the highly virulent H5N1 virus replicated more efficiently and induced a weaker IFN response than the H5N1 virus that exhibited low virulence in mammals in an earlier study. Our data suggest that the H5N1 viruses tested, especially the virus with the high-pathogenicity phenotype, possess greater capability to attenuate the type I IFN response than the human H3N2 virus. The attenuation of this critical host innate immune defense may contribute to the virulence of H5N1 viruses observed in humans.},

Respiratory symptoms were frequently associated with virus infection, with relatively high rate of gastrointestinal symptoms reported. To better understand 2009 H1N1 virus pathogenesis in humans, we studied virus and host responses following infection of two cell types: polarized bronchial and pharyngeal epithelial cells, which exhibit many features of the human airway epithelium, and colon epithelial cells to serve as a human intestinal cell model. Selected 2009 H1N1 viruses were compared to both seasonal H1N1 and triple-reassortant swine H1N1 influenza viruses that have circulated among North American pigs since before the 2009 pandemic. All H1N1 viruses replicated productively in airway cells; however, in contrast to seasonal H1N1 virus infection, infection with the 2009 H1N1 and triple-reassortant swine H1N1 viruses resulted in an attenuated inflammatory response, a weaker interferon response, and reduced cell death. Additionally, the H1N1 viruses of swine origin replicated less efficiently at the temperature of the human proximal airways (33C). We also observed that the 2009 H1N1 viruses replicated to significantly higher titers than seasonal H1N1 virus in polarized colon epithelial cells. These studies reveal that in comparison to seasonal influenza virus, H1N1 viruses of swine origin poorly activate multiple aspects of the human innate response, which may contribute to the virulence of these viruses. In addition, their less efficient replication at human upper airway temperatures has implications for the understanding of pandemic H1N1 virus adaptation to humans.},

abstract = {CD8+ T lymphocyte responses are a critical arm of the immune response to respiratory virus infection and may play a role in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease. We have shown that CD8+ T cells induce significant lung injury in the absence of virus infection by adoptive transfer into mice with alveolar expression of a viral transgene. The injury is characterized by the parenchymal infiltration of host cells, primarily macrophages, which correlates with physiologic deficits in transgenic animals. CD8+ T cellmediated lung injury can occur in the absence of perforin and Fas expression as long as TNF-$\alpha$ is available. Here, we show that the effect of TNF-$\alpha$ expressed by CD8+ T cells is mediated not exclusively by cytotoxicity, but also through the activation of alveolar target cells and their expression of inflammatory mediators. CD8+ T cell recognition of alveolar cells in vitro triggered monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) expression in the targets, which was mediated by TNF-$\alpha$. Antigen-dependent alveolar MCP-1 expression was observed in vivo as early as 3 hours after CD8+ T cell transfer and depended upon TNF-R1 expression in transgenic recipients. MCP-1 neutralization significantly reduced parenchymal infiltration after T cell transfer. We conclude that alveolar epithelial cells actively participate in the inflammation and lung injury associated with CD8+ T cell recognition of alveolar antigens.

abstract = {T lymphocytes (T cells) express T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules on their surface that can recognize peptides (p) derived from antigenic proteins bound to products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The pMHC molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). T cells first encounter antigen on DCs in lymph nodes (LN). Intravital microscopy experiments show that upon entering the LN containing antigen, CD8+ T cells first move rapidly. After a few hours, they stop and make extended contacts with DCs. The factors that determine when and how this transition occurs are not well understood. We report results from computer simulations that suggest that the duration of phase one is related to the low probability of productive interactions between T cells and DCs. This is demonstrated by our finding that the antigen dose and type determine when such a transition occurs. These results are in agreement with experimental observations. TCR-pMHC binding characteristics and the antigen dose determine the time required for a productive T-cell-DC encounter (resulting in sustained contact). We find that the ratio of this time scale and the half-life of the pMHC complex itself provide a consolidated measure of antigen quantity and type. Results obtained upon varying different measures of antigen quantity and type fall on one curve when graphed against this ratio of time scales. Thus, we provide a mechanism for how the effects of varying one set of parameters are influenced by other prevailing conditions. This understanding should help guide future experimentation.},

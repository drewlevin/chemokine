abstract = {The proliferation of computing into the physical world promises more than the ubiquitous availability of computing infrastructure; it suggest new paradigms of interaction inspired by constant access to information and computational capabilities. For the past decade, application-driven research on abiquitous computing (ubicomp) has pushed three interaction themes:natural interfaces, context-aware applications,andautomated capture and access. To chart a course for future research in ubiquitous computing, we review the accomplishments of these efforts and point to remaining research challenges. Research in ubiquitious computing implicitly requires addressing some notion of scale, whether in the number and type of devices, the physical space of distributed computing, or the number of people using a system. We posit a new area of applications research, everyday computing, focussed on scaling interaction with respect to time. Just as pushing the availiability of computing away from the traditional desktop fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and computers, providing continuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant companion. Designing for continous interaction requires addressing interruption and reumption of intreaction, representing passages of time and providing associative storage models. Inherent in all of these interaction themes are difficult issues in the social implications of ubiquitous computing and the challenges of evaluating> ubiquitious computing research. Although cumulative experience points to lessons in privacy, security, visibility, and control, there are no simple guidelines for steering research efforts. Akin to any efforts involving new technologies, evaluation strategies form a spectrum from technology feasibility efforts to long-term use studiesbut a user-centric perspective is always possible and necessary},

abstract = {Skin dendritic cells (DCs) are thought to act as key initiators of local T cell immunity. Here we show that after skin infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation required MHC class I-restricted presentation by nonmigratory CD8(+) DCs rather than skin-derived DCs. Despite a lack of direct presentation by migratory DCs, blocking their egress from infected skin substantially inhibited class I-restricted presentation and HSV-specific CTL responses. These results support the argument for initial transport of antigen by migrating DCs, followed by its transfer to the lymphoid-resident DCs for presentation and CTL priming. Given that relatively robust CTL responses were seen with small numbers of skin-emigrant DCs, we propose that this inter-DC antigen transfer functions to amplify presentation across a larger network of lymphoid-resident DCs for efficient T cell activation.},

abstract = {The structure determination of voltage-gated channels by the combination of molecular modeling and mutagenesis experiments is a long term, iterative process. As such, the models should be considered as a work in progress, with changes expected as more data becomes available. The primary role of the models is that they assimilate the known data and provide ideas for further experiments to elucidate the real structures. Although the models presented here have already gone through two or three cycles of development and testing, many aspects remain tentative. Perhaps the most significant result so far is that the P segment was experimentally confirmed to form the ion-selective part of the channel. In a subsequent cycle of testing and modeling, the specific residues responsibility for Na+ and Ca2+ selectivity have been identified and the selectivity filter of K+ channels is now predicted to be formed by the side chains, but rather by the carbonyl oxygens of the conserved Gly-Tyr-Gly sequence backbone. As another example, the 9p residue of the P segment of K+ channels was originally modeled as either being buried in the protein or accessible channels was originally modeled as either being buried in the protein or accessible from inside the cell only. However, once mutation of this residue to histidine was found to affect blockade by extracellular TEA, protons, Zn2+ and histidine reagents (DeBiasi et al., 1993), the models were updated to have this and the hydrophilic residues in the first part of P form a helix that comprises part of the extracellular, outer vestibular of the pore. While this motif was used also for Na+ and Ca2+ pore models (see Fig. 2) where the putative helices are amphipathic, it remains to be verified. Modeling of the size and shape of the outer vestibule of K+ channels was also aided by the data for the binding of CTX in the extracellular entrance to the pore. Similarly, experiments with peptide toxins such as mu and omega conotoxins may prove useful in modeling the outer vestibules of the Na+ and/or Ca2+ channels. While important advances have been made, it is important to realize that these approaches are still very new. In the future we are likely to see improvements on both the theoretical and experimental sides which will greatly advance the process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) References: 46},

abstract = {Bronchiolar epithelial cells are the prime targets for influenza A virus infection. It still remains to be clarified which signals are generated from these cells to initiate an immune response. Among chemokines, viral infection of primary lung epithelial cells triggered exclusively the release of CXCL8/interleukin-8 (IL-8), which contrasts with our previous observation that influenza A virus induced in monocytes the expression of mononuclear-leukocyte-attracting chemokines and even suppressed the production of neutrophil-attracting chemokines. Therefore, we speculated that it may be advantageous for respiratory epithelial cells to release primarily neutrophil-attracting CXCL8/IL-8 since neutrophils rapidly remove necrotic debris and are the first line of defense against bacterial superinfections. This concept has also been supported by our finding that influenza A virus infection led to necrosis of lung epithelial cells. This is in striking contrast to previous studies where influenza A virus infection induced apoptosis in monocytes and epithelial cells from origins other than the lung. Thus, the cell type instead of the virus determines which death pathway will be followed. In addition to the release of CXCL8/IL-8, we obtained a massive release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) from virus-infected lung cells. However, whereas the CXCL8/IL-8 secretion was accompanied by induced gene activation, the transcription rate of MIF remained unchanged during the infection course and the virus-induced MIF release was predominantly a discharge from intracellular stores, suggesting that MIF is passively released upon cell death. Despite virus induced necrosis, the passively liberated MIF remained bioactive. Considering the well-established immunostimulatory effects of MIF on different leukocyte subsets, is its very likely that enhanced levels of MIF may contribute to the host immune response during the acute phase of influenza A virus infection in humans.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression or survival analysis, are frequently used as a means to answer scientific questions in psychosomatic research. Many who use these techniques, however, apparently fail to appreciate fully the problem of overfitting, ie, capitalizing on the idiosyncrasies of the sample at hand. Overfitted models will fail to replicate in future samples, thus creating considerable uncertainty about the scientific merit of the finding. The present article is a nontechnical discussion of the concept of overfitting and is intended to be accessible to readers with varying levels of statistical expertise. The notion of overfitting is presented in terms of asking too much from the available data. Given a certain number of observations in a data set, there is an upper limit to the complexity of the model that can be derived with any acceptable degree of uncertainty. Complexity arises as a function of the number of degrees of freedom expended (the number of predictors including complex terms such as interactions and nonlinear terms) against the same data set during any stage of the data analysis. Theoretical and empirical evidence-with a special focus on the results of computer simulation studies-is presented to demonstrate the practical consequences of overfitting with respect to scientific inference. Three common practices-automated variable selection, pretesting of candidate predictors, and dichotomization of continuous variables-are shown to pose a considerable risk for spurious findings in models. The dilemma between overfitting and exploring candidate confounders is also discussed. Alternative means of guarding against overfitting are discussed, including variable aggregation and the fixing of coefficients a priori. Techniques that account and correct for complexity, including shrinkage and penalization, also are introduced.},

abstract = {We analyzed the dynamics of an influenza A/Albany/1/98 (H3N2) viral infection, using a set of mathematical models highlighting the differences between in vivo and in vitro infection. For example, we found that including virion loss due to cell entry was critical for the in vitro model but not for the in vivo model. Experiments were performed on influenza virus-infected MDCK cells in vitro inside a hollow-fiber (HF) system, which was used to continuously deliver the drug amantadine. The HF system captures the dynamics of an influenza infection, and is a controlled environment for producing experimental data which lend themselves well to mathematical modeling. The parameter estimates obtained from fitting our mathematical models to the HF experimental data are consistent with those obtained earlier for a primary infection in a human model. We found that influenza A/Albany/1/98 (H3N2) virions under normal experimental conditions at 37 degrees C rapidly lose infectivity with a half-life of approximately 6.6+/-0.2 h, and that the lifespan of productively infected MDCK cells is approximately 13 h. Finally, using our models we estimated that the maximum efficacy of amantadine in blocking viral infection is approximately 74\%, and showed that this low maximum efficacy is likely due to the rapid development of drug resistance.},

abstract = {In the early phases of an immune response, T cells of appropriate antigen specificity become activated by antigen-presenting cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Two-photon microscopy imaging experiments have shown that this stimulation occurs in distinct stages during which T cells exhibit different motilities and interactions with dendritic cells (DCs). In this paper, we utilize the Cellular Potts Model, a model formalism that takes cell shapes and cellular interactions explicitly into account, to simulate the dynamics of, and interactions between, T cells and DCs in the lymph node paracortex. Our three-dimensional simulations suggest that the initial decrease in T-cell motility after antigen appearance is due to "stop signals" transmitted by activated DCs to T cells. The long-lived interactions that occur at a later stage can only be explained by the presence of both stop signals and a high adhesion between specific T cells and antigen-bearing DCs. Furthermore, our results indicate that long-lasting contacts with T cells are promoted when DCs retract dendrites that detect a specific contact at lower velocities than other dendrites. Finally, by performing long simulations (after prior fitting to short time scale data) we are able to provide an estimate of the average contact duration between T cells and DCs.},

abstract = {Dufour's gland is the origin of the trail pheromone of Gnamptogenys striatula. Chemical analysis of the glandular extracts revealed a series of new natural products, especially esters of (2E)-3,4,7-trimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol (4-methylgeraniol), and (2E)-3,4,7-trimethyl-2,6-nonadien-1-ol (a bishomogeraniol isomer) with medium-chain fatty acids. Bioassays with synthetic racemates of the esters revealed that the 4-methylgeranyl esters are highly active as trail pheromones, while the bishomogeranyl esters are either marginally active or not active at all. Assays with the individual 4-methylgeranyl esters showed each of them to be inferior to the glandular secretion in eliciting trail following. However, the mixture of racemic 4-methylgeranyl octanoate and the corresponding decanoate and dodecanoate, the main Dufour's volatile constituents, is as active as the natural secretion at similar concentration. We conclude that the trail pheromone constitutes a mixture of at least the 4-methylgeranyl esters identified in the gland. Since G. striatula generally preys on small arthropods rather than monopolizing large resources, we assume that trails are rarely used during foraging, but more often during nest migration. Production of new societies in this species is generally performed by budding, a period of considerable predation risk. Utilizing trails for efficient displacement in this context is, therefore, highly adaptive. This behavioral repertoire may also provide the ants with additional means of food resource exploitation.},

abstract = {Infection of cells with influenza A virus results in cell death with apoptotic characteristics. Apoptosis is regarded as a non-inflammatory process. However, during influenza an inflammatory response occurs in the airway epithelium. An examination of this apparent paradox was made using influenza A virus infection of human nasal and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Some cytokine genes (IL-18, CCL2 and CCL5) were expressed constitutively in nasal cells but no cytokine was released. In bronchiolar cells, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and CXCL8 expression was constitutive, whilst CCL2 and CCL5 expression was upregulated following influenza virus infection. IL-6, CXCL8 and CCL5 were released but IL-1 beta and CCL2 were not. In bronchiolar cells, cell death was inhibited by the caspase-8 (Z-IETD-fmk) and pan-caspase (Z-VAD-fmk) inhibitors and these inhibitors enhanced expression of CCL5 and increased the levels of the three secreted cytokines significantly. Thus, the amount of each cytokine released from bronchiolar cells is reduced during cell death, implying that the observed inflammatory response in influenza would be greater if cell death did not occur. Reduced cytokine release is also associated with fragmentation of the Golgi body, as the caspase inhibitors also rescued influenza A virus-induced fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon.},

A pressure-flow relationship that describes blood cell transit is implemented in the network. Regional flow is investigated by imposing gravity-dependent transpulmonary and transmural boundary conditions. Comparisons of red and white blood cell transit times in the upper, mid, and lower lung showed physiologically consistent trends of a decreasing average transit time and an increased homogeneity of transit time distributions as a result of increasing average capillary diameter and flow down the height of a vertical lung. The model was found to reproduce experimentally consistent trends in red blood cell transit times and relative blood flows with respect to lung height. This model enables flow properties and cell transit time behavior in the pulmonary microcirculation under varying conditions, for example in different "zones" of the lung, to be explored.},

Mean flock size increased from 4 to 7 when the predator was present. Whether the predator was present or absent, scanning rate decreased with increasing flock size. As the flock size increased with hawk's presence, the relative advantages of flocking increased as the frequency of attacks increased. The hawk's presence tended to increase scanning at the expense of feeding time more than interference. However, feeding time of an individual foraging wiht others, compared to a solitary's feeding time, showed a greater relative increase when the hawk was present. Thus, flocking advantages are greater with increasing attack frequency. With increasing group size, increase both dilution and many-eyes effect},

abstract = {CD8+ T cells have a crucial role in resistance to pathogens and can kill malignant cells; however, some critical functions of these lymphocytes depend on helper activity provided by a distinct population of CD4+ T cells. Cooperation between these lymphocyte subsets involves recognition of antigens co-presented by the same dendritic cell, but the frequencies of such antigen-bearing cells early in an infection and of the relevant naive T cells are both low. This suggests that an active mechanism facilitates the necessary cell-cell associations. Here we demonstrate that after immunization but before antigen recognition, naive CD8+ T cells in immunogen-draining lymph nodes upregulate the chemokine receptor CCR5, permitting these cells to be attracted to sites of antigen-specific dendritic cell-CD4+ T cell interaction where the cognate chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 (also known as MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta) are produced. Interference with this actively guided recruitment markedly reduces the ability of CD4+ T cells to promote memory CD8+ T-cell generation, indicating that an orchestrated series of differentiation events drives nonrandom cell-cell interactions within lymph nodes, optimizing CD8+ T-cell immune responses involving the few antigen-specific precursors present in the naive repertoire.},

Here we investigated the protective value of defined in vitrogenerated hemagglutinin (HA) peptide-specific primary CD8 T cell effectors from the clone 4 T cell receptor transgenic mice, secreting type 1 or type 2 cytokines, against pulmonary infection with whole influenza virus. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes producing type 1 and type 2 cytokine (Tc1 and Tc2) populations were equally cytolytic, but Tc1 effectors and not Tc2 effectors reduced the pulmonary virus titer early during infection. Host recovery mediated by Tc1 effectors was found to be independent of interferon $\gamma$ production. Tc2 effectors entered the lung with delayed kinetics as compared with Tc1 effectors, and after lung entry Tc2 effector cells did not localize near the infected airway epithelium as did Tc1 effectors but were found within clusters of inflammatory cells distant from the epithelium. We also show that the expression of several chemokine receptors was selectively regulated in the Tc1 and Tc2 subsets. Thus, the protective value of a CD8 cell population against pulmonary influenza virus infection is strongly correlated with its ability to exert its effector potential at the site of virus infection.},

abstract = {Background: Fatal human respiratory disease associated with influenza A subtype H5N1 has been documented in Hong Kong, and more recently in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. We previously demonstrated that patients with H5N1 disease had unusually high serum levels of IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10). Furthermore, when compared with human influenza virus subtype H1N1, the H5N1 viruses in 1997 (A/Hong Kong/483/97) (H5N1/97) were more potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-a) and chemokines (e.g. IP-10) from primary human macrophages in vitro, which suggests that cytokines dysregulation may play a role in pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. Since respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target cell for replication of influenza viruses, it is pertinent to investigate the cytokine induction profile of H5N1 viruses in these cells. Methods: We used quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA to compare the profile of cytokine and chemokine gene expression induced by H5N1 viruses A/HK/483/97 (H5N1/97), A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04 (both H5N1/04) with that of human H1N1 virus in human primary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Results: We demonstrated that in comparison to human H1N1 viruses, H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses were more potent inducers of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in primary human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Recent H5N1 viruses from Vietnam (H5N1/04) appeared to be even more potent at inducing IP-10 than H5N1/97 virus. Conclusion: The H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human respiratory epithelial cells than subtype H1N1 virus. We suggest that this hyper-induction of cytokines may be relevant to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease.},

abstract = {Influenza H5N1 virus continues to be enzootic in poultry and transmits zoonotically to humans. Although a swine-origin H1N1 virus has emerged to become pandemic, its virulence for humans remains modest in comparison to that seen in zoonotic H5N1 disease. As human respiratory epithelium is the primary target cells for influenza viruses, elucidating the viral tropism and host innate immune responses of influenza H5N1 virus in human bronchial epithelium may help to understand the pathogenesis. Here we established primary culture of undifferentiated and well differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and infected with highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 virus (A/Vietnam/3046/2004) and a seasonal influenza H1N1 virus (A/Hong Kong/54/1998), the viral replication kinetics and cytokine and chemokine responses were compared by qPCR and ELISA. We found that the in vitro culture of the well differentiated NHBE cells acquired the physiological properties of normal human bronchi tissue which express high level of $\alpha$2-6-linked sialic acid receptors and human airway trypsin-like (HAT) protease, in contrast to the low expression in the non-differentiated NHBE cells. When compared to H1N1 virus, the H5N1 virus replicated more efficiently and induced a stronger type I interferon response in the undifferentiated NHBE cells. In contrast, in well differentiated cultures, H5N1 virus replication was less efficient and elicited a lower interferon-beta response in comparison with H1N1 virus. Our data suggest that the differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells has a major influence in cells' permissiveness to human H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses and the host innate immune responses. The reduced virus replication efficiency partially accounts for the lower interferon-beta responses in influenza H5N1 virus infected well differentiated NHBE cells. Since influenza infection in the bronchial epithelium will lead to tissue damage and associate with the epithelium regeneration, the data generated from the undifferentiated NHBE cultures may also be relevant to disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10/CXCL10 is a chemokine associated with type 1 T cell responses, regulating the migration of activated T cells through binding to the CXCR3 receptor. Expression of both CXCL10 and CXCR3 are observed during immunopathological diseases of the CNS, and this receptor/ligand pair is thought to play a central role in regulating T cell-mediated inflammation in this organ site. In this report, we investigated the role of CXCL10 in regulating CD8(+) T cell-mediated inflammation in the virus-infected brain. This was done through analysis of CXCL10-deficient mice infected intracerebrally with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which in normal immunocompetent mice induces a fatal CD8(+) T cell-mediated meningoencephalitis. We found that a normal antiviral CD8(+) T cell response was generated in CXCL10-deficient mice, and that lack of CXCL10 had no influence on the accumulation of mononuclear cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, analysis of the susceptibility of CXCL10-deficient mice to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-induced meningitis revealed that these mice just like CXCR3-deficient mice were partially resistant to this disease, whereas wild-type mice invariably died. Furthermore, despite marked up-regulation of the two remaining CXCR3 ligands: CXCL9 and 11, we found a reduced accumulation of CD8(+) T cells in the brain parenchyma around the time point when wild-type mice succumb as a result of CD8(+) T cell-mediated inflammation. Thus, taken together these results indicate a central role for CXCL10 in regulating the accumulation of effector T cells at sites of CNS inflammation, with no apparent compensatory effect of other CXCR3 ligands.},

To study the role of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 in the migration and positioning of virus-specific effector T-cells within the brain, CXCR3-deficient mice were infected intracerebrally with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Analysis of the induction phase of the antiviral CD8+ T-cell response did not reveal any immune defects in CXCR3-deficient mice. Yet, when mice were challenged with LCMV intracerebrally, most CXCR3-deficient mice survived the infection, whereas wild-type mice invariably died from CD8+ T-cell-mediated immunopathology. Quantitative analysis of the cellular infiltrate in CSF of infected mice revealed modest, if any, decrease in the number of mononuclear cells recruited to the meninges in the absence of CXCR3. However, immunohistological analysis disclosed a striking impairment of CD8+ T-cells from CXCR3-deficient mice to migrate from the meninges into the outer layers of the brain parenchyma despite similar localization of virus-infected target cells. Reconstitution of CXCR3-deficient mice with wild-type CD8+ T-cells completely restored susceptibility to LCMV-induced meningitis. Thus, taken together, our results strongly point to a critical role for CXCR3 in the positioning of effector T-cells at sites of viral inflammation in the brain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the costs and treatments associated with influenza patients with and without secondary viral or bacterial infections in a managed care setting. METHODS: Patients with influenza diagnoses (ICD-9 = 487) were identified in the PharMetrics database between January 1, 1997 and June 30, 1998. Patients were placed into 3 cohorts: influenza only (INF), influenza plus a secondary bacterial respiratory infection (BRI), and influenza plus a secondary viral respiratory infection (VRI). The index date was defined as the date of the first occurrence of an influenza diagnosis during the study period. Medical claims were assessed from the index date to the end of the influenza episode, which was defined as the date of the last claim for influenza followed by a 90-day "clean period" during which no influenza-related charges occurred. RESULTS: A total of 18,000 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 29 years, and 54\% were female. Approximately 93\% of patients were placed in the INF cohort, and 3\% each in the BRI and VRI groups. The BRI cohort had the highest mean total cost (\$5593* SD = 10,939), compared with the VRI cohort (\$847 SD = 1782) and INF cohort (\$602 SD = 2813) (P less than.0001 vs INF; P less than.0001 vs VRI). This total cost disparity was primarily driven by differences in inpatient costs: BRI (\$3509, SD = 9474); VRI (\$208, SD = 1327); INF (\$138, SD = 2145). Patients in the BRI cohort averaged 0.5 hospitalizations per patient vs 0.06 in the VRI cohort and 0.03 in the INF cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects in the BRI cohort were significantly more costly and had an increased risk of hospitalization as compared with subjects in the VRI or INF cohorts. Early intervention with antiviral agents and/or antibiotics, where appropriate, could result in significant cost savings for managed care organizations.},

abstract = {The immune response to influenza A virus is characterized by an influx of both macrophages and T lymphocytes into the lungs of the infected host, accompanied by induced expression of a number of CC chemokines. CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 are both expressed on activated macrophages and T cells. We examined how the absence of these chemokine receptors would affect pulmonary chemokine expression and induced leukocyte recruitment by infecting CCR5-deficient mice and CCR2-deficient mice with a mouse-adapted strain of influenza A virus. CCR5(-/-) mice displayed increased mortality rates associated with acute, severe pneumonitis, whereas CCR2(-/-) mice were protected from the early pathological manifestations of influenza because of defective macrophage recruitment. This delay in macrophage accumulation in CCR2(-/-) mice caused a subsequent delay in T cell migration, which correlated with high pulmonary viral titers at early time points. Infected CCR5(-/-) mice and CCR2(-/-) mice both exhibited increased expression of the gene for MCP-1, the major ligand for CCR2(-/-) and a key regulator of induced macrophage migration. These studies illustrate the very different roles that CCR5 and CCR2 play in the macrophage response to influenza infection and demonstrate how defects in macrophage recruitment affect the normal development of the cell-mediated immune response.},

Gett and Hodgkin Nat. Immunol. 1:239-244, 2000 have pioneered the quantitative analysis of CFSE data. We confirm and extend their data analysis approach using simple mathematical models. We employ the extended Gett and Hodgkin Nat.

The same data is also fitted with a simple mathematical model that we derived by reformulating the numerical model of Deenick et al. J. Immunol. 170:4963-4972, 2003. By a non-linear fitting procedure we estimate parameter values and confidence intervals to identify the parameters that are influenced by the IL-2 concentration. We obtain a significantly better fit to the data when we assume that the T cell death rate depends on the number of divisions cells have completed. We provide an outlook on future work that involves extending the Deenick et al. J. Immunol. 170:4963-4972, 2003 model into the classical smith-martin model, and into a model with arbitrary probability distributions for death and division through subsequent divisions.},

abstract = {T cells play a key role in the control of viral infection in the CNS but may also contribute to immune-mediated cell damage. To study the redundancy of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 in regulating virus-induced CD8+ T cell-mediated inflammation in the brain, CXCR3/CCR5 double-deficient mice were generated and infected intracerebrally with noncytolytic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Because these chemokine receptors are mostly expressed by overlapping subsets of activated CD8+ T cells, it was expected that absence of both receptors would synergistically impair effector T cell invasion and therefore protect mice against the otherwise fatal CD8+ T cell-mediated immune attack. Contrary to expectations, the accumulation of mononuclear cells in cerebrospinal fluid was only slightly delayed compared with mice with normal expression of both receptors. Even more surprising, CXCR3/CCR5 double-deficient mice were more susceptible to intracerebral infection than CXCR3-deficient mice. Analysis of effector T cell generation revealed an accelerated antiviral CD8+ T cell response in CXCR3/CCR5 double-deficient mice. Furthermore, while the accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the neural parenchyma was significantly delayed in both CXCR3- and CXCR3/CCR5-deficient mice, more CD8+ T cells were found in the parenchyma of double-deficient mice when these were analyzed around the time when the difference in clinical outcome becomes manifest. Taken together, these results indicate that while CXCR3 plays an important role in controlling CNS inflammation, other receptors but not CCR5 also contribute significantly. Additionally, our results suggest that CCR5 primarily functions as a negative regulator of the antiviral CD8+ T cell response.},

AntNet is a distributed, mobile agents based Monte Carlo system that was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor for solving optimization problems. AntNet's agents concurrently explore the network and exchange collected information. The communication among the agents is indirect and asynchronous, mediated by the network itself. This form of communication is typical of social insects and is called stigmergy. We compare our algorithm with six state-of-the-art routing algorithms coming from the telecommunications and machine learning fields. The algorithms' performance is evaluated over a set of realistic testbeds. We run many experiments over real and artificial IP datagram networks with increasing number of nodes and under several paradigmatic spatial and temporal traffic distributions. Results are very encouraging. AntNet showed superior performance under all the experimental conditions with respect to its competitors. We analyze the main characteristics of the algorithm and try to explain the reasons for its superiority.},

abstract = {In humans, the elderly and immunocompromised are at greatest risk for disseminated West Nile virus (WNV) infection, yet the immunologic basis for this remains unclear. We demonstrated previously that B cells and IgG contributed to the defense against disseminated WNV infection (Diamond, M.S., B. Shrestha, A. Marri, D. Mahan, and M. Engle. 2003. J. Virol. 77:25782586). In this paper, we addressed the function of IgM in controlling WNV infection. C57BL/6J mice (sIgM/) that were deficient in the production of secreted IgM but capable of expressing surface IgM and secreting other immunoglobulin isotypes were vulnerable to lethal infection, even after inoculation with low doses of WNV. Within 96 h, markedly higher levels of infectious virus were detected in the serum of sIgM/ mice compared with wild-type mice. The enhanced viremia correlated with higher WNV burdens in the central nervous system, and was also associated with a blunted anti-WNV IgG response. Passive transfer of polyclonal anti-WNV IgM or IgG protected sIgM/ mice against mortality, although administration of comparable amounts of a nonneutralizing monoclonal anti-WNV IgM provided no protection. In a prospective analysis, a low titer of anti-WNV IgM antibodies at day 4 uniformly predicted mortality in wild-type mice. Thus, the induction of a specific, neutralizing IgM response early in the course of WNV infection limits viremia and dissemination into the central nervous system, and protects against lethal infection.},

abstract = {The Time Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem (TDVRP) consists in optimally routing a fleet of vehicles of fixed capacity when travel times are time dependent, in the sense that the time employed to traverse each given arc, depends on the time of the day the travel starts from its originating node. The optimization method consists in finding solutions that minimize two hierarchical objectives: the number of tours and the total travel time. Optimization of total travel time is a continuous optimization problem that in our approach is solved by discretizing the time space in a suitable number of subspaces. New time dependent local search procedures are also introduced, as well as conditions that guarantee that feasible moves are sought for in constant time. This variant of the classic Vehicle Routing Problem is motivated by the fact that in urban contexts variable traffic conditions play an essential role and can not be ignored in order to perform a realistic optimization. In this paper it is shown that when dealing with time constraints, like hard delivery time windows for customers, the known solutions for the classic case become unfeasible and the degree of unfeasibility increases with the variability of traffic conditions, while if no hard time constraints are present, the classic solutions become suboptimal. Finally an application of the model to a real case is presented. The model is integrated with a robust shortest path algorithm to compute time dependent paths between each customer pairs of the time dependent model.},

Ants of the artificial colony are able to generate successively shorter feasible tours by using information accumulated in the form of a pheromone trail deposited on the edges of the TSP graph. Computer simulations demonstrate that the artificial ant colony is capable of generating good solutions to both symmetric and asymmetric instances of the TSP.

abstract = {Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, we examined the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system biology. We found that these genes display significantly higher rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. Importantly, this trend is most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein evolution is most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral primates to humans. Thus, the remarkable phenotypic evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate, i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those linked to nervous system development. In addition to uncovering broad evolutionary trends, our study also identified many candidate genes-most of which are implicated in regulating brain size and behavior-that might have played important roles in the evolution of the human brain.},

abstract = {IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10, CXCL10), a chemokine secreted from cells stimulated with type I and II IFNs and LPS, is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. Expression of IP-10 is seen in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells into sites of tissue inflammation. To determine the in vivo function of IP-10, we constructed an IP-10-deficient mouse (IP-10(-/-)) by targeted gene disruption. Immunological analysis revealed that IP-10(-/-) mice had impaired T cell responses. T cell proliferation to allogeneic and antigenic stimulation and IFN-gamma secretion in response to antigenic challenge were impaired in IP-10(-/-) mice. In addition, IP-10(-/-) mice exhibited an impaired contact hypersensitivity response, characterized by decreased ear swelling and reduced inflammatory cell infiltrates. T cells recovered from draining lymph nodes also had a decreased proliferative response to Ag restimulation. Furthermore, IP-10(-/-) mice infected with a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus had an impaired ability to control viral replication in the brain. This was associated with decreased recruitment of CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes into the brain, reduced levels of IFN-gamma and the IFN-gamma-induced chemokines monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig, CXCL9) and IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC, CXCL11) in the brain, decreased numbers of virus-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD8(+) cells in the spleen, and reduced levels of demyelination in the CNS. Taken together, our data suggest a role for IP-10 in both effector T cell generation and trafficking in vivo.},

Here we investigate relationships among antigen presentation, T cell motility, and local production of effector cytokines by CD4+ T cells within hepatic granulomas triggered by Bacille Calmette-Gu\'{e}rin or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. At steady-state, only small fractions of mycobacteria-specific T cells showed antigen-induced migration arrest within granulomas, resulting in low-level, polarized secretion of cytokines. However, exogenous antigen elicited rapid arrest and robust cytokine production by the vast majority of effector T cells. These findings suggest that limited antigen presentation and/or recognition within granulomas evoke a muted T cell response drawing on only a fraction of the host's potential effector capacity. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of host-protective functions, especially how antigen availability influences T cell dynamics and, in turn, effector T cell function during chronic infection.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a cell culture model of human alveolar epithelial cells in primary culture for the in vitro study of pulmonary absorption and transport. METHODS: Type II pneumocytes isolated from normal human distal lung tissue by enzyme treatment and subsequent purification were plated on fibronectin/collagen coated polyester filter inserts, and cultured using a low-serum growth medium. Characterization of the cell culture was achieved by bioelectric measurements, cell-specific lectin binding, immunohistochemical detection of cell junctions, and by assessment of transepithelial transport of dextrans of varying molecular weights. RESULTS: In culture, the isolated cells spread into confluent monolayers, exhibiting peak transepithelial resistance of 2,180 62 ohms x cm2 and potential difference of 13.5 1.0 mV (n = 30-48), and developing tight junctions as well as desmosomes. As assessed by lectin-binding, the cell monolayers consisted of mainly type I cells with some interspersed type II cells, thus well mimicking the situation in vivo. The permeability of hydrophilic macromolecular FITC-dextrans across the cell monolayer was found to be inversely related to their molecular size, with Papp values ranging from 1.7 to 0.2 x 10(-8) cm/sec. CONCLUSIONS: A primary cell culture model of human alveolar epithelial cells has been established, which appears to be a valuable in vitro model for pulmonary drug delivery and transport studies.},

Thus, animals are expected to evolve strategies that use information to improve foraging success. We study how desert seed harvesters use information to improve the rate they collect seeds, which contributes to the colony's fitness. Through field studies and computer simulations, we manipulated the information available to the ants in the spatial distribution of seeds and measured the resulting foraging rates. In field observations, seeds were collected faster when seeds could be found with less information. The increase in foraging rate with clustering was indistinguishable across three related species that vary over an order of magnitude in colony size. Computer simulations show similar systematic increases in foraging rates when information about the food location is communicated among nestmates.},

abstract = {Animals may acquire information socially, but do they also need to learn independently to make effective use of such information? Tandem running is a form of recruitment in certain ants in which one individual leads another to an important resource such as a better nest site. Tandem runs speed information flow because tandem followers typically discover new nest sites much more rapidly than through independent searching. Moreover, tandem followers often go on to lead new tandem runs, thereby recruiting others. However, former tandem followers do not slavishly follow the route they have been shown. Here, we show that individual ants can improve upon the directness and reduce the duration of tandem runs they subsequently lead but do so only if, between being a follower and becoming a tandem leader, they have explored independently. Similarly, an ant that independently discovers a new nest site, and subsequently leads tandem runs to such a discovery, improves upon the route taken only when she has also explored independently after finding the nest site. Thus, we show that learning through independent exploration is important both to individuals and to their society because it augments information gained through tandem runs and is the basis of route improvement. This will further hasten the transfer of information between members of the society, causing more effective information cascades. Tandem running allows one ant to teach another the location of a resource, but to improve their routes, taught ants also need to learn for themselves.},

abstract = {Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells, and play a critical role in immune protection. Our knowledge of how the CTL killing efficiency varies with CTL and target cell numbers is limited. Here, we simulate a region of lymphoid tissue using a cellular Potts model to characterize the functional response of CTL killing of target cells, and find that the total killing rate saturates both with the CTL and the target cell densities. The relative saturation in CTL and target cell densities is determined by whether a CTL can kill multiple target cells at the same time, and whether a target cell can be killed by many CTLs together. We find that all the studied regimes can be well described by a double-saturation (DS) function with two different saturation constants. We show that this DS model can be mechanistically derived for the cases where target cells are killed by a single CTL. For the other cases, a biological interpretation of the parameters is still possible. Our results imply that this DS function can be used as a tool to predict the cellular interactions in cytotoxicity data. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in immunology, several key parameters determining virus dynamics in infected hosts remain largely unknown. For example, the rate at which specific effector and memory CD8 T cells clear virus-infected cells in vivo is hardly known for any viral infection. We propose a framework to quantify T-cell-mediated killing of infected or peptide-pulsed target cells using the widely used in vivo cytotoxicity assay. We have reanalyzed recently published data on killing of peptide-pulsed splenocytes by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and memory CD8 T cells specific to NP396 and GP276 epitopes of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in the mouse spleen. Because there are so many effector CD8 T cells in spleens of mice at the peak of the immune response, NP396- and GP276-pulsed targets are estimated to have very short half-lives of 2 and 14 min, respectively. After the effector numbers have diminished, i.e., in LCMV-immune mice, the half-lives become 48 min and 2.8 h for NP396- and GP276-expressing targets, respectively. Analysis of several alternative models demonstrates that the estimates of half-life times of peptide-pulsed targets are not affected when changes are made in the model assumptions. Our report provides a unifying framework to compare killing efficacies of CD8 T-cell responses specific to different viral and bacterial infections in vivo, which may be used to compare efficacies of various cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-based vaccines.},

abstract = {The kinetics of recirculation of naive lymphocytes in the body has important implications for the speed at which local infections are detected and controlled by immune responses. With a help of a novel mathematical model, we analyze experimental data on migration of 51Cr-labeled thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDLs) via major lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues of rats in the absence of systemic antigenic stimulation. We show that at any point of time, 95\% of lymphocytes in the blood travel via capillaries in the lung or sinusoids of the liver and only 5\% migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, or the spleen. Interestingly, our analysis suggests that lymphocytes travel via lung capillaries and liver sinusoids at an extremely rapid rate with the average residence time in these tissues being less than 1 minute. The model also predicts a relatively short average residence time of TDLs in the spleen (2.5 hours) and a longer average residence time of TDLs in major lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (10 hours). Surprisingly, we find that the average residence time of lymphocytes is similar in lymph nodes draining the skin (subcutaneous LNs) or the gut (mesenteric LNs) or in Peyer's patches. Applying our model to an additional dataset on lymphocyte migration via resting and antigen-stimulated lymph nodes we find that enlargement of antigen-stimulated lymph nodes occurs mainly due to increased entrance rate of TDLs into the nodes and not due to decreased exit rate as has been suggested in some studies. Taken together, our analysis for the first time provides a comprehensive, systems view of recirculation kinetics of thoracic duct lymphocytes in the whole organism.},

abstract = {Some ants have an extraordinary social organization, called unicoloniality, whereby individuals mix freely among physically separated nests. This type of social organization is not only a key attribute responsible for the ecological domination of these ants, but also an evolutionary paradox and a potential problem for kin selection theory because relatedness between nest mates is effectively zero. The introduction of the Argentine ant in Europe was apparently accompanied by a dramatic loss of inter-nest aggression and the formation of two immense supercolonies (which effectively are two unicolonial populations). Introduced populations experienced only limited loss of genetic diversity at neutral markers, indicating that the breakdown of recognition ability is unlikely to be merely due to a genetic bottleneck. Rather, we suggest that a genetic cleansing of recognition cues occurred after introduction. Indeed workers of the same supercolony are never aggressive to each other despite the large geographical distance and considerable genetic differentiation between sampling sites. By contrast, aggression is invariably extremely high between the two supercolonies, indicating that they have become fixed for different recognition alleles. The main supercolony, which ranges over 6,000 km from Italy to the Spanish Atlantic coast, effectively forms the largest cooperative unit ever recorded.},

This book aims to fill this gap, providing the first comprehensive, accessible, and international introduction to cell phone culture and theory. It offers a clear yet sophisticated overview of mobile telecommunications, putting the technology in historical and technical context. Cell Phone Culture is a fascinating biography of an important cultural object, that adopts an integrated, multiperspectival approach to the cultural and social shaping of technology. Goggin considers the mobile phone from the standpoint of its history, production, design, consumption, and representation, as well as its deep implication in contemporary media convergence - such as digital photography, mobile blogging, mobile Internet, and mobile television. Interdisciplinary in its conceptual framework, Cell Phone Culture draws on a wide range of national, regional, and international examples, to carefully explore the new forms of consumption and use of communication and media technology that the phenomenon of mobiles represents. Cell Phone Culture also reflects upon the challenges and provocations of mobile phone technology, use, and consumption for doing cultural and media studies today.},

abstract = {A genetic algorithm (GA) is a procedure that mimics processes occurring in Darwinian evolution to solve computational problems. A GA introduces variation through "mutation" and "recombination" in a "population" of possible solutions to a problem, encoded as strings of characters in "genomes," and allows this population to evolve, using selection procedures that favor the gradual enrichment of the gene pool with the genomes of the "fitter" individuals. GAs are particularly suitable for optimization problems in which an effective system design or set of parameter values is sought.In nature, genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) form the basic control layer in the regulation of gene expression levels. GRNs are composed of regulatory interactions between genes and their gene products, and are, inter alia, at the basis of the development of single fertilized cells into fully grown organisms. This paper describes how GAs may be applied to find functional regulatory schemes and parameter values for models that capture the fundamental GRN characteristics. The central ideas behind evolutionary computation and GRN modeling, and the considerations in GA design and use are discussed, and illustrated with an extended example. In this example, a GRN-like controller is sought for a developmental system based on Lewis Wolpert's French flag model for positional specification, in which cells in a growing embryo secrete and detect morphogens to attain a specific spatial pattern of cellular differentiation.},

abstract = {Behavioral plasticity in social insects is intriguing because colonies adjust to environmental change through the aggregated responses of individuals. Without central control, colonies adjust numbers of workers allocated to various tasks. Individual decisions are based on local information from the environment and other workers. This study examines how colonies of the seed-eating ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus adjust the intensity of foraging in an arid environment where conspecific neighbors compete for foraging area. The main question is how foragers decide whether to leave the nest. Patrollers search the area before foragers emerge. Removal experiments show that the return of the patrollers stimulates the onset of foraging, and later, the rate at which foragers return affects the rate at which foragers continue to leave the nest. Foraging activity is less sensitive to changes in the rate of returning foragers than to changes in the rate of returning patrollers. These results suggest that whether a colony forages at all on a given day depends on conditions detected early by patrollers but that once foraging begins, the intensity of foraging does not track, on an hourly timescale, how quickly foragers can find food.},

abstract = {Social insect colonies operate without central control or any global assessment of what needs to be done by workers. Colony organization arises from the responses of individuals to local cues. Red harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) regulate foraging using interactions between returning and outgoing foragers. The rate at which foragers return with seeds, a measure of food availability, sets the rate at which outgoing foragers leave the nest on foraging trips. We used mimics to test whether outgoing foragers inside the nest respond to the odor of food, oleic acid, the odor of the forager itself, cuticular hydrocarbons, or a combination of both with increased foraging activity. We compared foraging activity, the rate at which foragers passed a line on a trail, before and after the addition of mimics. The combination of both odors, those of food and of foragers, is required to stimulate foraging. The addition of blank mimics, mimics coated with food odor alone, or mimics coated with forager odor alone did not increase foraging activity. We compared the rates at which foragers inside the nest interacted with other ants, blank mimics, and mimics coated with a combination of food and forager odor. Foragers inside the nest interacted more with mimics coated with combined forager/seed odors than with blank mimics, and these interactions had the same effect as those with other foragers. Outgoing foragers inside the nest entrance are stimulated to leave the nest in search of food by interacting with foragers returning with seeds. By using the combined odors of forager cuticular hydrocarbons and of seeds, the colony captures precise information, on the timescale of seconds, about the current availability of food.},

abstract = {CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor that is rapidly induced on na\"{\i}ve T cells following activation, and preferentially remains highly expressed on type-1 helper (Th1)-type CD4(+) T cells, effector CD8(+) T cells and innate-type lymphocytes, such as natural killer (NK) and NKT cells. CXCR3 is activated by three interferon (IFN)-$\gamma$-inducible ligands CXCL9 (monokine induced by gamma-interferon), CXCL10 (interferon-induced protein-10) and CXCL11 (interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant). Although some studies have revealed that these ligands have redundant functions in vivo, other studies have demonstrated that the three CXCR3 ligands can also collaborate and even compete with each other. Differential regulation of the three ligands at specific times in defined anatomically restricted locations in vivo likely participates in the fine control of T-cell trafficking over the course of an immune response. Among the differences in regulation, CXCL10 is induced by a variety of innate stimuli that induce IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$ as well as the adaptive immune cell cytokine IFN-$\gamma$, whereas CXCL9 induction is restricted to IFN-$\gamma$. In this review, we will discuss how the balance, timing and pattern of CXCR3 ligand expression appears to regulate the generation of effector T cells in the lymphoid compartment and subsequent migration into peripheral sites of Th1-type inflammation in which the CXCR3 ligands also then regulate the interactions and migratory behavior of effector T cells in an inflamed peripheral tissue.},

SLC is a highly efficacious chemoattractant for lymphocytes with preferential activity toward naive T cells. Moreover, SLC induces firm adhesion of naive T lymphocytes via beta2 integrin binding to the counter receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, a necessary step for lymphocyte recruitment. SLC is the first chemokine demonstrated to have the characteristics required to mediate homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, the expression of SLC in lymphatic endothelium suggests that the migration of lymphocytes from tissues into efferent lymphatics may be an active process mediated by this molecule.},

abstract = {Understanding immunodominance, the phenomenon of epitope-specific T cells expanding in an often distinctly hierarchical fashion, is important for the design of T-cell-based intervention strategies. Several recent studies have investigated immunodominance of H-2Db-restricted CD8+ T cells specific for the nucleoprotein NP366 and acid polymerase PA224 epitopes during influenza A virus infection of C57BL/6 mice. CD8+ T cells specific for these two epitopes are codominant during primary infection; NP366 dominates during secondary infection. While a number of explanations for this observation have been proposed, none of them can fully account for all the observed data. In this article, we use a simple mathematical model to explain the seemingly inconsistent data. We show that the dynamic interactions between CD8+ T cells and antigen presentation lead to a situation where CD8+ T cells are limiting during the initial response whereas antigen is limiting in the secondary response. This numbers game between antigen and CD8+ T cells can reproduce the observed immunodominance of the NP336- and PA224-specific CD8+ T cells, thereby explaining the reported experimental data.},

abstract = {Since the first recorded infection of humans with H5N1 viruses of avian origin in 1997, sporadic human infections continue to occur with a staggering mortality rate of >60\%. Although sustained human-to-human transmission has not occurred yet, there is a growing concern that these H5N1 viruses might acquire this trait and raise the specter of a pandemic. Despite progress in deciphering viral determinants of pathogenicity, we still lack crucial information on virus/immune system interactions pertaining to severe disease and high mortality associated with human H5N1 influenza virus infections. Using two human isolates of H5N1 viruses that differ in their pathogenicity in mice, we have defined mechanistic links among the rate of viral replication, mortality, CD8 T cell responses, and immunopathology. The extreme pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses was directly linked to the ability of the virus to replicate rapidly, and swiftly attain high steady-state titers in the lungs within 48 hours after infection. The remarkably high replication rate of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus did not prevent the induction of IFN-$\beta$ or activation of CD8 T cells, but the CD8 T cell response was ineffective in controlling viral replication in the lungs and CD8 T cell deficiency did not affect viral titers or mortality. Additionally, BIM deficiency ameliorated lung pathology and inhibited T cell apoptosis without affecting survival of mice. Therefore, rapidly replicating, highly lethal H5N1 viruses could simply outpace and overwhelm the adaptive immune responses, and kill the host by direct cytopathic effects. However, therapeutic suppression of early viral replication and the associated enhancement of CD8 T cell responses improved the survival of mice following a lethal H5N1 infection. These findings suggest that suppression of early H5N1 virus replication is key to the programming of an effective host response, which has implications in treatment of this infection in humans.},

abstract = {This is the definitive scientific study of one of the most diverse animal groups on earth; pretty well everything that is known about ants is in this massive work. But books do not win Pulitzer Prizes, as this one did in 1991, for exhaustiveness; besides being the last word in science, this work is beautifully written, and accessible to the lay reader. Wilson, of Harvard, and Holldobler of the University of Wurzburg, may inspire a whole new generation of budding entomologists. Every branch of biology is covered, from evolution to taxonomy to physiology to ecology. Lavishly illustrated, it is full of amazing facts, many concerning the incredible social behavior of these creatures. This landmark work, the distillation of a lifetime of research by the world's leading myrmecologists, is a thoroughgoing survey of one of the largest and most diverse groups of animals on the planet. H\"{o}lldobler and Wilson review in exhaustive detail virtually all topics in the anatomy, physiology, social organization, ecology, and natural history of the ants. In large format, with almost a thousand line drawings, photographs, and painting, it is one of the most visually rich and all-encompassing view of any group of organisms on earth. It will be welcomed both as an introduction to the subject and as an encyclopedia reference for researchers in entomology, ecology, and sociobiology.},

abstract = {We examined the extent to which CXCR3 mediates resistance to dengue infection. Following intracerebral infection with dengue virus, CXCR3-deficient (CXCR3(-/-)) mice showed significantly higher mortality rates than wild-type (WT) mice; moreover, surviving CXCR3(-/-) mice, but not WT mice, often developed severe hind-limb paralysis. The brains of CXCR3(-/-) mice showed higher viral loads than those of WT mice, and quantitative analysis using real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry revealed fewer T cells, CD8(+) T cells in particular, in the brains of CXCR3(-/-) mice. This suggests that recruitment of effector T cells to sites of dengue infection was diminished in CXCR3(-/-) mice, which impaired elimination of the virus from the brain and thus increased the likelihood of paralysis and/or death. These results indicate that CXCR3 plays a protective rather than an immunopathological role in dengue virus infection. In studies to identify critical CXCR3 ligands, CXCL10/IFN-inducible protein 10-deficient (CXCL10/IP-10(-/-)) mice infected with dengue virus showed a higher mortality rate than that of the CXCR3(-/-) mice. Although CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL9/monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and CXCL11/IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant share a single receptor and all three of these chemokines are induced by dengue virus infection, the latter two could not compensate for the absence of CXCL10/IP-10 in this in vivo model. Our results suggest that both CXCR3 and CXCL10/IP-10 contribute to resistance against primary dengue virus infection and that chemokines that are indistinguishable in in vitro assays differ in their activities in vivo.},

We undertook studies to track directly Ag presentation to CD8 T cells in vivo through the first 72 h after infection with OVA-expressing influenza A virus. We found that Ag presentation by DCs occurs strictly in the draining lymph nodes and not within the lung itself. Surprisingly, Ag presentation was found to be mediated by a CD11b(+) DC population. Finally, the expression of antigenic complexes on DCs correlated with the location and timing of CD8 T cell activation. These results have implications for approaches to control influenza A virus infection.},

abstract = {Many social insects use pheromones to communicate and coordinate their activities. Investigation of intraspecific differences in pheromone use is a new area of social insect research. For example, interindividual variation in alarm pheromone content has been found in physical castes of polymorphic ants. Many ant species use multiple trail pheromones. Here we present novel research into trail pheromone variations between behavioral subcastes of pharaoh ants, Monomorium pharaonis. Monomorium pharaonis is attracted to trail pheromones found in its poison glands (monomorines) and Dufour's glands (faranal). We show that the most abundant monomorines, I (M1) and III (M3), can be readily detected in pheromone trails. A behaviorally distinct subcaste known as ¿pathfinder¿ foragers can relocate long-lived pheromone trails. Chemical analysis showed that pathfinder foragers had low M3:M1 ratios (mean 3.09 ± 1.53, range 1.03¿7.10). Nonpathfinder foragers had significantly greater M3:M1 ratios (38.3 ± 60.0, range 3.54¿289). We found that M3:M1 ratio did not differ between foragers of different age but was correlated with behavioral subcaste at all ages. The relative abundance of M3:M1 on foraging trails ranged from 3.03¿41.3 over time during pheromone trail build-up. M3:M1 ratio also varied spatially throughout trail networks, being lowest on trail sections closest to a food source (M3:M1 = 1.9¿3.61) and highest near the nest (M3:M1 = 67¿267). Our results indicate a functional role for differences in pheromone trail composition, whereby pathfinder foragers might preferentially mark sections of pheromone trail networks for future exploration.},

Even though it is a potential means to regulate the size, quality, and duration of a tissue infiltrate, T cell egress from infected tissues is poorly understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, we found that CD8 effector T cells egressed from the infected lung in a CCR7-dependent manner. In contrast, following antigen recognition, effector CD8 T cell egress decreased and CCR7 function was reduced in vivo and in vitro, indicating that the exit of CD8 T cells from infected tissues is tightly regulated. Our data suggest that the regulation of T cell egress is a mechanism to retain antigen-specific effectors at the site of infection to promote viral clearance, while decreasing the numbers of bystander T cells and preventing overt inflammation.},

Here, we report a comprehensive quantitative analysis of virus-specific IgG and IgA BMem dispersion after transient influenza pneumonia in mice. From early in the response, BMem circulated continuously and dispersed widely to secondary lymphoid tissues. However, a complicated picture emerged with BMem frequency differences between secondary lymphoid tissues indicating an influence of local tissue factors on trafficking. BMem numbers increased and stabilized at tissue-specific frequencies without contraction of the BMem pool during the period of analysis. The lung was notable as a nonsecondary lymphoid tissue where a rapid influx of IgG and IgA BMem established relatively high frequencies that were maintained long term. Our findings provide insights into the pattern of BMem dispersion, and emphasize the lung as a complex repository of immune memory after local infection.},

The molecular signals responsible for the directed migration of virus-specific T cells and their cellular sources are presently unknown. Here we demonstrate that in response to WNV infection, neurons secrete the chemokine CXCL10, which recruits effector T cells via the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Neutralization or a genetic deficiency of CXCL10 leads to a decrease in CXCR3+ CD8+ T-cell trafficking, an increase in viral burden in the brain, and enhanced morbidity and mortality. These data support a new paradigm in chemokine neurobiology, as neurons are not generally considered to generate antiviral immune responses, and CXCL10 may represent a novel neuroprotective agent in response to WNV infection in the central nervous system.},

abstract = {Effector T cells are a crucial component of the adaptive immune response to respiratory virus infections. Although it was previously reported that the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 affect trafficking of respiratory virus-specific CD8+ T cells, it is unclear whether these receptors govern effector CD4+ T cell migration to the lungs. To assess the role of CCR5 and CXCR3 in vivo, we directly compared the migration of Ag-specific wild-type and chemokine receptor-deficient effector T cells in mixed bone marrow chimeric mice during a parainfluenza virus infection. CXCR3-deficient effector CD4+ T cells were 5- to 10-fold less efficient at migrating to the lung compared with wild-type cells, whereas CCR5-deficient effector T cells were not impaired in their migration to the lung. In contrast to its role in trafficking, CXCR3 had no impact on effector CD4+ T cell proliferation, phenotype, or function in any of the tissues examined. These findings demonstrate that CXCR3 controls virus-specific effector CD4+ T cell migration in vivo, and suggest that blocking CXCR3-mediated recruitment may limit T cell-induced immunopathology during respiratory virus infections.},

abstract = {The development of T cell memory from naive precursors is influenced by molecular cues received during T cell activation and differentiation. In this study, we describe a novel role for the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 in regulating effector CD8(+) T cell contraction and memory generation after influenza virus infection. We find that Ccr5(-/-) Cxcr3(-/-) cells show markedly decreased contraction after viral clearance, leading to the establishment of massive numbers of memory CD8(+) T cells. Ccr5(-/-) Cxcr3(-/-) cells show reduced expression of CD69 in the lung during the peak of infection, which coincides with differential localization and the rapid appearance of memory precursor cells. Analysis of single chemokine receptor-deficient cells revealed that CXCR3 is primarily responsible for this phenotype, although there is also a role for CCR5 in the enhancement of T cell memory. The phenotype could be reversed by adding exogenous antigen, resulting in the activation and contraction of Ccr5(-/-) Cxcr3(-/-) cells. Similar results were observed during chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Together, the data support a model of memory CD8(+) T cell generation in which the chemokine-directed localization of T cells within infected tissues regulates antigen encounter and controls the extent of CD8(+) T cell activation and differentiation, which ultimately regulates effector versus memory cell fate decisions.},

abstract = {The respiratory tract is characterized by an extensive surface area that is in direct contact with the environment, posing a significant problem for effective immune surveillance. Yet most respiratory pathogens are quickly recognized and controlled by a coordinated response involving the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The investigation of pulmonary immunity to respiratory viruses during a primary infection has demonstrated that multiple innate and adaptive immune mechanisms are necessary for efficient antiviral responses, and the inhibition of any single mechanism can have disastrous consequences for the host. Furthermore, the investigation of recall responses in the lung has shown that protection from a secondary challenge infection is a complex and elegant process that occurs in distinct stages. In this review, we discuss recent advances that describe the roles of individual components during primary and secondary responses to respiratory virus infections and how these discoveries have added to our understanding of antiviral immunity in the lung.},

We then applied the high resolution capability for determining the cardiovascular transit time which is an important physiological parameter in the study of animal models of cardiovascular disease. Two groups of mice, group 1 (n=12) with high body weight and group 2 (n=10) with low body weight, were studied. Each mouse was injected with a 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG; 40-50 \&amp;mu;L; 8-48 MBq) bolus and a list mode PET acquisition was started. MicroCT was performed for attenuation correction. We histogrammed the first 9 seconds of the list mode data into frames of 0.2 s-0.5 s duration. After the images were reconstructed and attenuation corrected, the ROIs were assigned to the following structures: vena cava, right and left ventricle blood pool (RV\&amp;LV), left lung and aorta. A time activity curve (VAC) of each ROI was generated. To correct for the recirculation, the end of each TAC was approximated by an exponential decay curve. The transit time (TT) was then calculated as the difference of the mean arrival times of the bolus in RV and LV. Short time frames of 0.3 s proved to be the best in terms of reducing noise and at the same being able to follow the rapid physiological processes. The peaks of the TACs showed good separation in various structures if the time spread of the bolus in the vena cava measured as full width of half maximum (FWHM) was shorter than 2 s. Group 1 had significantly (p<0.05) longer TT as expected than those of group 2.},

abstract = {Adaptive immune responses are characterized by substantial restructuring of secondary lymphoid organs. The molecular and cellular factors responsible for virus-induced lymphoid remodeling are not well known to date. Here we applied optical projection tomography, a mesoscopic imaging technique, for a global analysis of the entire 3-dimensional structure of mouse peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs), focusing on B-cell areas and high endothelial venule (HEV) networks. Structural homeostasis of PLNs was characterized by a strict correlation between total PLN volume, B-cell volume, B-cell follicle number, and HEV length. After infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, we observed a substantial, lymphotoxin (LT) beta-receptor-dependent reorganization of the PLN microarchitecture, in which an initial B-cell influx was followed by 3-fold increases in PLN volume and HEV network length on day 8 after infection. Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that virus-induced PLN and HEV network remodeling required LTalpha(1)beta(2)-expressing B cells, whereas the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor-A signaling pathways had no significant effect on PLN expansion. In summary, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-induced PLN growth depends on a vascular endothelial growth factor-A-independent, LT- and B cell-dependent morphogenic pathway, as revealed by an in-depth mesoscopic analysis of the global PLN structure.},

abstract = {The cellular immune response to primary influenza virus infection is complex, involving multiple cell types and anatomical compartments, and is difficult to measure directly. Here we develop a two-compartment model that quantifies the interplay between viral replication and adaptive immunity. The fidelity of the model is demonstrated by accurately confirming the role of CD4 help for antibody persistence and the consequences of immune depletion experiments. The model predicts that drugs to limit viral infection and/or production must be administered within 2 days of infection, with a benefit of combination therapy when administered early, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells in the lung are as effective for viral clearance as neutralizing antibodies when present at the time of challenge. The model can be used to investigate explicit biological scenarios and generate experimentally testable hypotheses. For example, when the adaptive response depends on cellular immune cell priming, regulation of antigen presentation has greater influence on the kinetics of viral clearance than the efficiency of virus neutralization or cellular cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that the modulation of antigen presentation or the number of lung resident cytotoxic cells and the combination drug intervention are strategies to combat highly virulent influenza viruses. We further compared alternative model structures, for example, B-cell activation directly by the virus versus that through professional antigen-presenting cells or dendritic cell licensing of CD8 T cells.},

abstract = {Although a wealth of knowledge about chemotaxis has accumulated in the past 40 years, these studies have been hampered by the inability of researchers to generate simple linear gradients instantaneously and to maintain them at steady state. Here we describe a device microfabricated by soft lithography and consisting of a network of microfluidic channels that can generate spatially and temporally controlled gradients of chemotactic factors. When human neutrophils are positioned within a microchannel, their migration in simple and complex interleukin-8 (IL-8) gradients can be tested. The cells exhibit strong directional migration toward increasing concentrations of IL-8 in linear gradients. Neutrophil migration halts abruptly when cells encounter a sudden drop in the chemoattractant concentration to zero ("cliff" gradient). When neutrophils are challenged with a gradual increase and decrease in chemoattractant ("hill" gradient), however, the cells traverse the crest of maximum concentration and migrate further before reversing direction. The technique described in this paper provides a robust method to investigate migratory cells under a variety of conditions not accessible to study by earlier techniques.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a power-conscious algorithm for jointly scheduling multi-rate periodic task graphs and aperiodic tasks in distributed real-time embedded systems. While the periodic task graphs have hard deadlines, the aperiodic tasks can have either hard or soft deadlines. Periodic task graphs are first scheduled statically. Slots are created in this static schedule to accommodate hard aperiodic tasks. Soft aperiodic tasks are scheduled dynamically with an on-line scheduler. Flexibility is introduced into the static schedule and optimized to allow the on-line scheduler to make dynamic modifications to the static schedule. This helps minimize the response times of soft aperiodic tasks through both resource reclaiming and slack stealing. Of course, the validity of the static schedule is maintained. The on-line scheduler also employs dynamic voltage scaling and power management to obtain a power-efficient schedule. Experimental results show that the flexibility introduced into the static schedule helps improve the response times of soft aperiodic tasks by up to 43\%. Dynamic voltage scaling and power management reduce power by up to 68\%. The scheme in which the static schedule is allowed to be flexible achieves up to 3.2\% more power saving compared to the scheme in which no flexibility is allowed, when both schemes are power-conscious. Our work gives an average architecture price saving of 30\% over a previous approach for embedded system architectures synthesized with execution slots for hard aperiodic tasks present},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Influenza A viruses of avian origin represent an emerging threat to human health as the progenitors of the next influenza pandemic. In recent years, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses have caused unprecedented epizootics on three continents and rare but highly fatal disease among humans exposed to diseased birds. Avian viruses of the H7 and H9 subtypes have also infected humans but generally resulted in far milder disease, yet they too should be considered as possible pandemic threats. Influenza virus infection elicits a complex network of host immune responses that, in uncomplicated influenza, results in effective control of the virus and the development of long-term memory responses. However, fatal avian H5N1 virus infection in both humans and experimental mammalian models is characterized by a high viral load in the respiratory tract, peripheral leukopenia and lymphopenia, a massive infiltration of macrophages into the lung, and dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine responses. This review focuses on avian influenza viruses as a pandemic threat, their induction of host innate immune responses in mammalian species, and the contribution of these responses to the disease process.},

abstract = {The CD8+ T cell diaspora has been analyzed after secondary challenge with an influenza A virus that replicates only in the respiratory tract. Numbers of DbNP366- and DbPA224-specific CD8+ T cells were measured by tetramer staining at the end of the recall response, then followed sequentially in the lung, lymph nodes, spleen, blood, and other organs. The extent of clonal expansion did not reflect the sizes of the preexisting memory T cell pools. Although the high-frequency CD8+ tetramer+ populations in the pneumonic lung and mediastinal lymph nodes fell rapidly from peak values, the whole mouse virus-specific CD8+ T cell counts decreased only 2-fold over the 4 weeks after infection, then subsided at a fairly steady rate to reach a plateau at about 2 months. The largest numbers were found throughout in the spleen, then the bone marrow.

abstract = {The CD8(+) T cell diaspora has been analyzed after secondary challenge with an influenza A virus that replicates only in the respiratory tract. Numbers of D(b)NP(366)- and D(b)PA(224)-specific CD8(+) T cells were measured by tetramer staining at the end of the recall response, then followed sequentially in the lung, lymph nodes, spleen, blood, and other organs. The extent of clonal expansion did not reflect the sizes of the preexisting memory T cell pools. Although the high-frequency CD8(+) tetramer(+) populations in the pneumonic lung and mediastinal lymph nodes fell rapidly from peak values, the "whole mouse" virus-specific CD8(+) T cell counts decreased only 2-fold over the 4 weeks after infection, then subsided at a fairly steady rate to reach a plateau at about 2 months. The largest numbers were found throughout in the spleen, then the bone marrow. The CD8(+)D(b)NP(366)+ and CD8(+)D(b)PA(224)+ sets remained significantly enlarged for at least 4 months, declining at equivalent rates while retaining the nucleoprotein > acid polymerase immunodominance hierarchy characteristic of the earlier antigen-driven phase.

abstract = {Ant colony optimization (ACO) can be applied to the data mining field to extract rule-based classifiers. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we provide an overview of previous ant-based approaches to the classification task and compare them with state-of-the-art classification techniques, such as C4.5, RIPPER, and support vector machines in a benchmark study. On the other hand, a new ant-based classification technique is proposed, named AntMiner+. The key differences between the proposed AntMiner+ and previous AntMiner versions are the usage of the better performing MAX-MIN ant system, a clearly defined and augmented environment for the ants to walk through, with the inclusion of the class variable to handle multiclass problems, and the ability to include interval rules in the rule list. Furthermore, the commonly encountered problem in ACO of setting system parameters is dealt with in an automated, dynamic manner. Our benchmarking experiments show an AntMiner+ accuracy that is superior to that obtained by the other AntMiner versions, and competitive or better than the results achieved by the compared classification techniques.},

abstract = {Antigen-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) are used as natural adjuvants for vaccination, but the factors that influence the efficacy of this treatment are poorly understood. We investigated the parameters that affect the migration of subcutaneously injected mouse-mature DCs to the draining lymph node. We found that the efficiency of DC migration varied with the number of injected DCs and that CCR7+/+ DCs migrating to the draining lymph node, but not CCR7-/- DCs that failed to do so, efficiently induced a rapid increase in lymph node cellularity, which was observed before the onset of T cell proliferation. We also report that DC migration could be increased up to 10-fold by preinjection of inflammatory cytokines that increased the expression of the CCR7 ligand CCL21 in lymphatic endothelial cells. The magnitude and quality of CD4+ T cell response was proportional to the number of antigen-carrying DCs that reached the lymph node and could be boosted up to 40-fold by preinjection of tumor necrosis factor that conditioned the tissue for increased DC migration. These results indicate that DC number and tissue inflammation are critical parameters for DC-based vaccination.},

abstract = {Bronchial epithelial cells are primary sites of airway viral infection, and these cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases. It has recently been reported that bronchial epithelial cells express RANTES. RANTES attracts monocytes, T cells, eosinophils, and basophils; it can also activate eosinophils. To determine whether viral infection induces RANTES expression on bronchial epithelial cells, we infected a bronchial epithelial cell line, NCI-H292, with influenza virus A (H3N2). We then examined the concentration of RANTES in the culture medium of infected cells by ELISA and assessed expression of the gene for RANTES by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We also investigated the concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the medium of infected cells, because some virus infections have been reported to induce expression of these cytokines on bronchial epithelial cells, but there are few data concerning influenza virus infection. Small amounts of IL-6 and IL-8 were detected in the medium of uninfected cells. RANTES was not detected in the medium of uninfected cells. After influenza virus infection, significant amounts of IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES were released into the culture medium of infected cells, and RANTES messenger RNA was detected from infected cells. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was not detected in the medium of uninfected and infected cells. These results suggest that influenza virus infection may stimulate production of IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES from human bronchial epithelial cells and that these cytokines may contribute to the pathogenesis of airway inflammatory diseases caused by influenza virus infection.},

By using spinning disk confocal intravital microscopy, we examined the kinetics and molecular mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment to sites of focal hepatic necrosis in vivo. Adenosine triphosphate released from necrotic cells activated the Nlrp3 inflammasome to generate an inflammatory microenvironment that alerted circulating neutrophils to adhere within liver sinusoids. Subsequently, generation of an intravascular chemokine gradient directed neutrophil migration through healthy tissue toward foci of damage. Lastly, formyl-peptide signals released from necrotic cells guided neutrophils through nonperfused sinusoids into the injury. Thus, dynamic in vivo imaging revealed a multistep hierarchy of directional cues that guide neutrophil localization to sites of sterile inflammation.},

However, it remains unclear whether CD8 T cells continue their proliferation after arriving in the lungs. To address this question, we developed a novel, in vivo, dual-label system using intranasal CFSE and BrdU administration to identify virus-specific CD8 T cells that are actively undergoing cell division while in the lungs. With this technique we demonstrate that a high frequency of virus-specific CD8 T cells incorporate BrdU while in the lungs and that this lung-resident proliferation contributes significantly to the magnitude of the Ag-specific CD8 T cell response following influenza virus infection.},

abstract = {Effector T cells significantly contribute to inflammatory diseases. These cells are recruited into tissue, where they orchestrate an inflammatory response that can either protect against infection or sometimes stimulate human disease. The recruitment of T cells into tissue from the blood and lymphoid compartments is an active process controlled by chemokines and the chemokine receptors expressed on distinct effector T-cell subsets. Thus, the chemokines secreted in the tissue will determine the specific types of T lymphocyte recruited into that tissue based on the chemokine receptors expressed on these cells. It follows that the chemokine receptor profile on T cells isolated from the lungs of patients with inflammatory pulmonary disease will define the subtype of pathogenic T lymphocytes mediating the disease process and will identify the mechanisms that recruit these cells into the lung. This article reviews data from both human and animal studies that define the chemokine receptors involved in the recruitment of T lymphocytes into the lung in various inflammatory pulmonary diseases, including asthma, obliterative bronchiolitis, sarcoidosis, and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. We then speculate on the potential role of these chemokine receptors in the pathogenesis of these disorders and potential novel therapeutic approaches suggested by these data.},

In particular, the use of a combination of two pheromone evaluation methods by the ants to find new solutions, a change of the influence of the heuristic on the decisions of the ants during the run of the algorithm, and the option that an elitist ant forgets the best-found solution are studied. We tested the ACO algorithm on a set of large benchmark problems from the Project Scheduling Library. Compared to several other heuristics for the RCPSP, including genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search, and different sampling methods, our algorithm performed best on average. For nearly one-third of all benchmark problems, which were not known to be solved optimally before, the algorithm was able to find new best solutions},

abstract = {Seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) continues to be a public health threat. However, we lack a detailed and quantitative understanding of the immune response kinetics to IAV infection and which biological parameters most strongly influence infection outcomes. To address these issues, we use modeling approaches combined with experimental data to quantitatively investigate the innate and adaptive immune responses to primary IAV infection. Mathematical models were developed to describe the dynamic interactions between target (epithelial) cells, influenza virus, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and virus-specific IgG and IgM. IAV and immune kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting models to a large data set obtained from primary H3N2 IAV infection of 340 mice. Prior to a detectable virus-specific immune response (before day 5), the estimated half-life of infected epithelial cells is 1.2 days, and the half-life of free infectious IAV is 4 h. During the adaptive immune response (after day 5), the average half-life of infected epithelial cells is 0.5 days, and the average half-life of free infectious virus is 1.8 min. During the adaptive phase, model fitting confirms that CD8+ CTLs are crucial for limiting infected cells, while virus-specific IgM regulates free IAV levels. This may imply that CD4 T cells and class-switched IgG antibodies are more relevant for generating IAV-specific memory and preventing future infection via a more rapid secondary immune response. Also, simulation studies were performed to understand the relative contributions of biological parameters to IAV clearance. This study provides a basis to better understand and predict influenza virus immunity.},

abstract = {The recirculation of T cells between the blood and secondary lymphoid organs requires that T cells are motile and sensitive to tissue-specific signals. T cell motility has been studied in vitro, but the migratory behavior of individual T cells in vivo has remained enigmatic. Here, using intravital two-photon laser microscopy, we imaged the locomotion and trafficking of naive CD4(+) T cells in the inguinal lymph nodes of anesthetized mice. Intravital recordings deep within the lymph node showed T cells flowing rapidly in the microvasculature and captured individual homing events. Within the diffuse cortex, T cells displayed robust motility with an average velocity of approximately 11 microm x min(-1). T cells cycled between states of low and high motility roughly every 2 min, achieving peak velocities >25 microm x min(-1). An analysis of T cell migration in 3D space revealed a default trafficking program analogous to a random walk. Our results show that naive T cells do not migrate collectively, as they might under the direction of pervasive chemokine gradients. Instead, they appear to migrate as autonomous agents, each cell taking an independent trafficking path. Our results call into question the role of chemokine gradients for basal T cell trafficking within T cell areas and suggest that antigen detection may result from a stochastic process through which a random walk facilitates contact with antigen-presenting dendritic cells.},

abstract = {Background: Despite preventive efforts, influenza epidemics are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality every year in the United States (US). Vaccination strategies to reduce disease burden have been implemented. However, no previous studies have systematically estimated the annual economic burden of influenza epidemics, an estimate necessary to guide policy makers effectively. Objective: We estimate age- and risk-specific disease burden, and medical and indirect costs attributable to annual influenza epidemics in the United States. Methods: Using a probabilistic model and publicly available epidemiological data we estimated the number of influenza-attributable cases leading to outpatient visits, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as time lost from work absenteeism or premature death. With data from health insurance claims and projections of either earnings or statistical life values, we then estimated healthcare resource utilization associated with influenza cases as were their medical and productivity (indirect) costs in \$2003. Results: Based on 2003 US population, we estimated that annual influenza epidemics resulted in an average of 610,660 life-years lost (undiscounted), 3.1 million hospitalized days, and 31.4 million outpatient visits. Direct medical costs averaged \$10.4 billion (95\% confidence interval [C.I.], \$4.1, \$22.2) annually. Projected lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amounted to \$16.3 billion (C.I., \$8.7, \$31.0) annually. The total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics using projected statistical life values amounted to \$87.1 billion (C.I., \$47.2, \$149.5). Conclusions: These results highlight the enormous annual burden of influenza in the US. While hospitalization costs are important contributors, lost productivity from missed work days and lost lives comprise the bulk of the economic burden of influenza. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In contrast to the remarkable chemokine responses of phagocytes and monocytes that were documented early on, lymphocytes have been considered for a long time to be poor targets for chemokine action. This view has changed dramatically with the discovery that peripheral blood T cells need to be activated before they can migrate in response to inflammatory chemokines. These chemokines do not act on the bulk of resting T cells that are in circulation. The identification of a new group of chemokines that selects resting, as opposed to effector, T and B cells was very exciting. These inflammation-unrelated chemokines affect transendothelial migration and localization of progenitor and mature lymphocytes in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. Here, we summarize the current view of chemokine-mediated lymphocyte traffic and focus on the molecular mechanisms by which T cell responses to chemokines are modulated. Recent developments in this area justify the hypothesis that the distinct migration patterns of lymphocytes throughout their life cycle-that is, during lymphopoiesis, antigen-dependent priming, inflammation and immune surveillance-are finely tuned by changing sets of chemokines that are selective for developmentally regulated chemokine receptors. Thus, the chemokine system assures that cell traffic during inflammatory responses occurs in the proper spatial and temporal fashion and disturbance of this system, therefore, can lead to inflammatory disease.},

abstract = {Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is occasionally found in the lungs of mice and humans; however, its role in respiratory immunity is unknown. Here we show that mice lacking spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches generate unexpectedly robust primary B- and T-cell responses to influenza, which seem to be initiated at sites of induced BALT (iBALT). Areas of iBALT have distinct B-cell follicles and T-cell areas, and support T and B-cell proliferation. The homeostatic chemokines CXCL13 and CCL21 are expressed independently of TNFalpha and lymphotoxin at sites of iBALT formation. In addition, mice with iBALT, but lacking peripheral lymphoid organs, clear influenza infection and survive higher doses of virus than do normal mice, indicating that immune responses generated in iBALT are not only protective, but potentially less pathologic, than systemic immune responses. Thus, iBALT functions as an inducible secondary lymphoid tissue for respiratory immune responses.},

We discuss the few multiscale models of influenza infection that have been developed in this emerging field. In addition to discussing modeling approaches, we also survey biological data on influenza infection and transmission that is relevant for constructing influenza infection models. We envision that, in the future, multiscale models that capitalize on technical advances in experimental biology and high performance computing could be used to describe the large spatial scale epidemiology of influenza infection, evolution of the virus, and transmission between hosts more accurately. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Chemokines mediate the trafficking and positioning of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues that is crucial for immune surveillance and immune responses. In particular, a CCR7 ligand, CCL21, plays important roles in recruiting T cells to secondary lymphoid tissues (SLT). Furthermore, CCL21 together with another CCR7 ligand, CCL19, direct the navigation and compartmentation of T cells within SLT. However, the distinct roles of these two chemokines for regulating cell trafficking and positioning are not clear. In this study, we explore the effect of co-existing CCL19 and CCL21 concentration fields on guiding T cell migration. Using microfluidic devices that can configure single and superimposed chemokine fields we show that under physiological gradient conditions, human peripheral blood T cells chemotax to CCL21 but not CCL19. Furthermore, T cells migrate away from the CCL19 gradient in a uniform background of CCL21. This repulsive migratory response is predicted by mathematical modeling based on the competition of CCL19 and CCL21 for CCR7 signaling and the differential ability of the two chemokines for desensitizing CCR7. These results suggest a new combinatorial guiding mechanism by CCL19 and CCL21 for the migration and trafficking of CCR7 expressing leukocytes.},

The lung is particularly susceptible to systemic toxin exposure resulting in acute leucocyte infiltration and vascular damage. In the present study, the functions of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) for chemokine regulation during acute lung inflammation were examined. Following administration of the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), lung mRNA levels of the chemokines cytokine-induced neutrophil chemo-attractant (KC), lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine (LIX), macrophage chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-2 were increased to a similar extent both in controls and in mice deficient for the IFN-gamma or 55 000 MW TNF receptors. In contrast, interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig) mRNA expression was markedly reduced in mice deficient for IFN-gamma or IFN-gamma receptor, but not in 55 000 MW TNF receptor knockout mice. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that IP-10 was highly expressed in lung interstitial macrophages of C57BL/6, but not of IFN-gamma receptor-deficient mice. In contrast to SEB administration, treatment with lipopolysaccharide resulted in a strong induction of IP-10 and Mig in IFN-gamma receptor-deficient mice. Together, these results establish a critical function of IFN-gamma for chemokine induction in acute lung inflammation that is dependent on the nature of the inflammatory stimulus.},

By two-photon microscopy of intact lymph nodes, we show that upon exposure to antigen, B cells migrate with directional preference toward the B-zoneT-zone boundary in a CCR7-dependent manner, through a region that exhibits a CCR7-ligand gradient. Initially the B cells show reduced motility, but after 1 d, motility is increased to approximately 9 $\mu$m/min. Antigen-engaged B cells pair with antigen-specific helper T cells for 10 to more than 60 min, whereas non-antigen-specific interactions last less than 10 min. B cellT cell conjugates are highly dynamic and migrate extensively, being led by B cells. B cells occasionally contact more than one T cell, whereas T cells are strictly monogamous in their interactions. These findings provide evidence of lymphocyte chemotaxis in vivo, and they begin to define the spatiotemporal cellular dynamics associated with T celldependent antibody responses.},

The pandemic virus is antigenically distinct from seasonal influenza viruses, and the majority of human population lacks immunity against this virus. We have studied the activation of innate immune responses in pandemic virus-infected human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages. Pandemic A/Finland/553/2009 virus, representing a typical North American/European lineage virus, replicated very well in these cells. The pandemic virus, as well as the seasonal A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) viruses, induced type I (alpha/beta interferon IFN-alpha/beta) and type III (IFN-lambda1 to -lambda3) IFN, CXCL10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression weakly in DCs. Mouse-adapted A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and human A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) viruses, instead, induced efficiently the expression of antiviral and proinflammatory genes. Both IFN-alpha and IFN-beta inhibited the replication of the pandemic (H1N1) virus. The potential of IFN-lambda3 to inhibit viral replication was lower than that of type I IFNs. However, the pandemic virus was more sensitive to the antiviral IFN-lambda3 than the seasonal A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1) virus. The present study demonstrates that the novel pandemic (H1N1) influenza A virus can readily replicate in human primary DCs and macrophages and efficiently avoid the activation of innate antiviral responses. It is, however, highly sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFNs, which may provide us an additional means to treat severe cases of infection especially if significant drug resistance emerges.},

abstract = {Influenza virus infection remains a public health problem worldwide. The mechanisms underlying viral control during an uncomplicated influenza virus infection are not fully understood. Here, we developed a mathematical model including both innate and adaptive immune responses to study the within-host dynamics of equine influenza virus infection in horses. By comparing modeling predictions with both interferon and viral kinetic data, we examined the relative roles of target cell availability, and innate and adaptive immune responses in controlling the virus. Our results show that the rapid and substantial viral decline (about 2 to 4 logs within 1 day) after the peak can be explained by the killing of infected cells mediated by interferon activated cells, such as natural killer cells, during the innate immune response. After the viral load declines to a lower level, the loss of interferon-induced antiviral effect and an increased availability of target cells due to loss of the antiviral state can explain the observed short phase of viral plateau in which the viral level remains unchanged or even experiences a minor second peak in some animals. An adaptive immune response is needed in our model to explain the eventual viral clearance. This study provides a quantitative understanding of the biological factors that can explain the viral and interferon kinetics during a typical influenza virus infection.},

abstract = {It is generally recognized that larger animals eat more, live longer, have larger offspring, and so on; but it is unusual to see these commonplace observations as a basis for scientific biology. A large number of empirically based relationships describe biological rates as simple functions of body size; and other such relations predict the intrinsic rate of population growth, animal speed, animal density, territory size, prey size, physiology, and morphology. Such equations almost always exist for mammals and birds, often for other vertebrates and invertebrates, sometimes for protozoa, algae, and bacteria, and occasionally even for plants. There are too many organisms to measure all aspects of the biology of every species of population, so scientists must depend on generalizations. Body size relations represent our most extensive and powerful assemblage of generalizations, but they have never been organized for use in ecology. This book represents the largest single compilation of interspecific size relations, and instructs the reader on the use of these relationships; their comparison, combination, and criticism. Both strengths and weaknesses of our current knowledge are discussed in order to indicate the many possible directions for further research. This important volume will therefore provide a point of departure toward a new applied ecology, giving quantitative solutions to real questions.

Harvester ants are recruited for outside work, using networks of brief antennal contacts, in the nest chamber closest to the nest exit: the entrance chamber. Here, we combine empirical observations, image analysis and computer simulations to investigate the structure and function of the interaction network in the entrance chamber. Ant interactions were distributed heterogeneously in the chamber, with an interaction hot-spot at the entrance leading further into the nest. The distribution of the total interactions per ant followed a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of highly connected individuals. Numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration of observation. An ant's interaction frequency was explained by its path shape and location within the entrance chamber. Computer simulations demonstrate that variation among individuals in connectivity accelerates information flow to an extent equivalent to an increase in the total number of interactions. Individual variation in connectivity, arising from variation among ants in location and spatial behaviour, creates interaction centres, which may expedite information flow.},

abstract = {We present an empirically based group model of foraging interactions in Messor pergandei, the Sonoran desert harvesting ant. M. pergandei colonies send out daily foraging columns consisting of tens of thousands of individual ants. Each day, the directions of the columns may change depending on the resource availability and the neighbor interactions. If neighboring columns meet, ants fight, and subsequent foraging is suppressed. M. pergandei colonies face a general problem which is present in many systems: dynamic spatial partitioning in a constantly changing environment, while simultaneously minimizing negative competitive interactions with multiple neighbors.Our simulation model of a population of column foragers is spatially explicit and includes neighbor interactions. We study how different behavioral strategies influence resource exploitation and space use for different nest distributions and densities. Column foraging in M. pergandei is adapted to the spatial and temporal properties of their natural habitat. Resource and space use is maximized both at the colony and the population level by a model with a behavioral strategy including learning and fast forgetting rates.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that tissue resident memory T cells (T(RM)) are critical to antiviral host defense in peripheral tissues. This new appreciation of T(RM) that reside in epithelial tissues and mediate host defense has been studied most extensively in skin: adult human skin contains large numbers of functional T(RM) that express skin specific markers. Indeed, more than twice as many T cells reside in skin as in peripheral blood. This T cell population has a diverse T cell receptor repertoire, and can produce a broad array of cytokines. More recently, we have begun to examine other epithelial tissues for the presence of resident T cells. In the present study, we asked whether analogous populations of resident T cells could be found in human lung. We were able to demonstrate abundant resident T cells in human lung-more than 10 billion T cells were present. Lung T cells were largely of the effector memory T cell (T(EM)) phenotype, though small numbers of central memory T cells (T(CM)) and T regulatory cells (T(reg)) could be identified. Lung T cells had a diverse T cell receptor repertoire and subsets produced IL-17, IL-4, IFN$\gamma$, as well as TNF$\alpha$. A significant number of lung T(RM) CD4+Th cells produced more than one cytokine, identifying them as "multifunctional" Th1 type cells. Finally, lung T(RM), but not T(RM) resident to skin or T cells from blood, proliferated in response to influenza virus. This work suggests that normal human lung contains large numbers of T(RM) cells, and these cells are poised to respond to recall antigens previously encountered through lung mucosa. This population of T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and other T cell mediated lung diseases.},

In the airways, where type IV collagen is abundant, but not the spleen, the CD49a(+) CD8 cells had reduced proportions of annexin V and caspase 8, and >80\% expressed the TNF-alpha receptor II, while Fas, TNFR-I, and CD27 expression were similar to CD49a(-) cells. Furthermore, the CD49a(+), but not CD49a(-), CD8 T cells from the airways were resistant to active induction of apoptosis in the presence of type IV collagen and TNF-alpha in vitro. We propose that TNFR-II and the VLA-1 synergize to protect effector CD8 T cells in the infected airways from apoptosis during the acute infection.},

@article{Rogers2009,
abstract = {As transistor density continues to grow at an exponential rate in accordance to Moore's law, the goal for many Chip Multi-Processor (CMP) systems is to scale the number of on-chip cores proportionally. Unfortunately, off-chip memory bandwidth capacity is projected to grow slowly compared to the desired growth in the number of cores. This creates a situation in which each core will have a decreasing amount of off-chip bandwidth that it can use to load its data from off-chip memory. The situation in which off-chip bandwidth is becoming a performance and throughput bottleneck is referred to as the bandwidth wall problem. In this study, we seek to answer two questions: (1) to what extent does the bandwidth wall problem restrict future multicore scaling, and (2) to what extent are various bandwidth conservation techniques able to mitigate this problem. To address them, we develop a simple but powerful analytical model to predict the number of on-chip cores that a CMP can support given a limited growth in memory traffic capacity. We find that the bandwidth wall can severely limit core scaling. When starting with a balanced 8-core CMP, in four technology generations the number of cores can only scale to 24, as opposed to 128 cores under proportional scaling, without increasing the memory traffic requirement. We find that various individual bandwidth conservation techniques we evaluate have a wide ranging impact on core scaling, and when combined together, these techniques have the potential to enable super-proportional core scaling for up to 4 technology generations.},

abstract = {A key question in pandemic influenza is the relative roles of innate immunity and target cell depletion in limiting primary infection and modulating pathology. Here, we model these interactions using detailed data from equine influenza virus infection, combining viral and immune (type I interferon) kinetics with estimates of cell depletion. The resulting dynamics indicate a powerful role for innate immunity in controlling the rapid peak in virus shedding. As a corollary, cells are much less depleted than suggested by a model of human influenza based only on virus-shedding data. We then explore how differences in the influence of viral proteins on interferon kinetics can account for the observed spectrum of virus shedding, immune response, and influenza pathology. In particular, induction of high levels of interferon ("cytokine storms"), coupled with evasion of its effects, could lead to severe pathology, as hypothesized for some fatal cases of influenza.},

abstract = {The immune response requires a timely interaction among different cell types within distinct microenvironments. Our studies have focused on the regulation of chemokine receptors in dendritic cells (DC) and T lymphocytes. Chemokine receptors expressed by immature DC promote their migration to inflamed tissues, where antigens are captured and maturation is induced. Maturing DC upregulate CCR7, which drives their migration to the T-cell areas of the draining lymph nodes where antigen is presented to na\"{\i}ve T cells. DC produce a variety of chemokines that influence DC recruitment into inflamed tissues and DC-T-cell interaction in the lymph nodes. Chemokine receptors are differentially acquired by developing Th1 and Th2 cells and are differentially expressed on subsets of "central memory" and "effector memory" T cells. Furthermore, following antigenic stimulation, effector T cells can rapidly switch chemokine receptor expression, acquiring new migratory capacities. These studies provide insights into the mechanisms that control T-cell priming as well as memory and effector immune responses.},

Here we present DNA polymorphism and divergence data from 34 genes thought to function in the innate immune system of Drosophila simulans and compare these data to those from 28 nonimmunity genes sequenced from the same lines. Several statistics, including average K(A)/K(S) ratio, average silent heterozygosity, and average haplotype diversity, significantly differ between the immunity and nonimmunity genes, suggesting an important role for directional selection in immune system protein evolution. In contrast to data from mammalian immunoglobulins and other proteins, we find no strong evidence for the selective maintenance of protein diversity in Drosophila immune system proteins. This may be a consequence of Drosophila's generalized innate immune response.},

We derive a two-phase approximate solution to the target cell limited influenza model and illustrate its accuracy using data and previously established parameter values of six patients infected with influenza A. For one patient, the fall in virus concentration from its peak was not consistent with our predictions during the decay phase and an alternate approximation is derived. We find expressions for the rate and length of initial viral growth in terms of model parameters, the extent each parameter is involved in viral peaks, and the single parameter responsible for virus decay.

abstract = {To fight infections, rare T cells must quickly home to appropriate lymph nodes (LNs), and reliably localize the antigen (Ag) within them. The first challenge calls for rapid trafficking between LNs, whereas the second may require extensive search within each LN. Here we combine simulations and experimental data to investigate which features of random T cell migration within and between LNs allow meeting these two conflicting demands. Our model indicates that integrating signals from multiple random encounters with Ag-presenting cells permits reliable detection of even low-dose Ag, and predicts a kinetic feature of cognate T cell arrest in LNs that we confirm using intravital two-photon data. Furthermore, we obtain the most reliable retention if T cells transit through LNs stochastically, which may explain the long and widely distributed LN dwell times observed in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that random migration, both between and within LNs, allows recruiting the majority of cognate precursors within a few days for various realistic infection scenarios. Thus, the combination of two-scale stochastic migration and signal integration is an efficient and robust strategy for T cell immune surveillance.},

Dynamic modeling is a powerful tool to integrate empirical data from independent sources, make novel predictions, and to foresee the gaps in the current knowledge. Dynamic models constructed to study the interactions between pathogens and hosts' immune responses have revealed key regulatory processes in the infection. Optimum complexity and dynamic modeling: We discuss the usability of various deterministic dynamic modeling approaches to study the progression of infectious diseases. The complexity of these models is dependent on the number of components and the temporal resolution in the model. We comment on the specific use of simple and complex models in the study of the progression of infectious diseases. Conclusions: Models of sub-systems or simplified immune response can be used to hypothesize phenomena of host-pathogen interactions and to estimate rates and parameters. Nevertheless, to study the pathogenesis of an infection we need to develop models describing the dynamics of the immune components involved in the progression of the disease.

abstract = {CXCL9 and CXCL10 mediate the recruitment of T lymphocytes and NK cells known to be important in viral surveillance. The relevance of CXCL10 in comparison to CXCL9 in response to genital HSV-2 infection was determined using mice deficient in CXCL9 (CXCL9-/-) and deficient in CXCL10 (CXCL10-/-) along with wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. An increased sensitivity to infection was found in CXCL10-/- mice in comparison to CXCL9-/- or WT mice as determined by detection of HSV-2 in the CNS at day 3 postinfection. However, by day 7 postinfection both CXCL9-/- and CXCL10-/- mice possessed significantly higher viral titers in the CNS in comparison to WT mice consistent with mortality (18-35\%) of these mice within the first 7 days after infection. Even though CXCL9-/- and CXCL10-/- mice expressed elevated levels of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL1 in the spinal cord in comparison to WT mice, there was a reduction in NK cell and virus-specific CD8+ T cell mobilization to this tissue, suggesting CXCL9 and CXCL10 are critical for recruitment of these effector cells to the spinal cord following genital HSV-2 infection. Moreover, leukocytes from the spinal cord but not from draining lymph nodes or spleens of infected CXCL9-/- or CXCL10-/- mice displayed reduced CTL activity in comparison to effector cells from WT mice. Thus, the absence of CXCL9 or CXCL10 expression significantly alters the ability of the host to control genital HSV-2 infection through the mobilization of effector cells to sites of infection.},

abstract = {Our current view of T cell differentiation and population dynamics is assembled from pieces of data obtained from separate experimental systems and is thus patchy. We reassessed homeostasis and dynamics of T cells 1) by generating a mathematical model describing the spatiotemporal features of T cell differentiation, and 2) by fitting this model to experimental data generated by disturbing T cell differentiation through transient depletion of dividing T cells in mice. This specific depletion was obtained by administration of ganciclovir to mice expressing the conditional thymidine kinase suicide gene in T cells. With this experimental approach, we could derive quantitative parameters describing the cell fluxes, residence times, and rates of import, export, proliferation, and death across cell compartments for thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants (RTEs). Among other parameters, we show that 93\% of thymocytes produced before single-positive stages are eliminated through the selection process. Then, a postselection peripheral expansion of naive T cells contributes three times more to naive T cell production than the thymus, with half of the naive T cells consisting of dividing RTEs. Altogether, this work provides a quantitative population dynamical framework of thymocyte development, RTEs, and naive T cells.},

abstract = {The role of Ag in the recruitment and localization of naive, acutely activated, and memory CD8(+) T cells to the lung during influenza infection was explored using TCR-transgenic (Tg) mice. Naive, Thy1.2(+)CD8(+) OT-I TCR-Tg cells were primed and recruited to the lung after transfer into congenic Thy1.1(+) recipients challenged with a genetically engineered influenza virus (influenza A/WSN/33 (WSN)-OVA(I)) containing the K(b) restricted OVA(257-264) epitope (siinfekl) in the viral neuraminidase stalk. However, if the transferred animals were infected with a similar influenza virus that expressed an irrelevant K(b) epitope (WSN-PEPII), no TCR-Tg T cells were detectable in the lung, although they were easily visible in the lymphoid organs. Conversely, there were substantial numbers of OT-I cells found in the lungs of WSN-PEPII-infected mice when the animals had been previously, or were concurrently, infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing OVA. Similar results were obtained with nontransgenic populations of memory CD8(+) T cells reactive to a murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 Ag. Interestingly, the primary host response to the immunodominant influenza nucleoprotein epitope was not affected by the presence of memory or recently activated OT-I T cells. Thus, although Ag is required to activate the T cells, the subsequent localization of T cells to the lung during a virus infection is a property of recently activated and memory T cells and is not necessarily driven by Ag in the lung.},

Although by definition T cell response size is the product of both the capacity to recruit na\"{\i}ve T cells (clonal selection) and their subsequent proliferation (clonal expansion), it remains undefined how these two factors regulate antigen-specific T cell responses. We determined the relative contribution of recruitment and expansion by labeling na\"{\i}ve T cells with unique genetic tags and transferring them into mice. Under disparate infection conditions with different pathogens and doses, recruitment of antigen-specific T cells was near constant and close to complete.

abstract = {In many immunological processes chemoattraction is thought to play a role in guiding cells to their sites of action. However, based on in vivo two-photon microscopy experiments in the absence of cognate antigen, T cell migration in lymph nodes (LNs) has been roughly described as a random walk. Although it has been shown that dendritic cells (DCs) carrying cognate antigen in some circumstances attract T cells chemotactically, it is currently still unclear whether chemoattraction of T cells towards DCs helps or hampers scanning. Chemoattraction towards DCs could on the one hand help T cells to rapidly find DCs. On the other hand, it could be deleterious if DCs become shielded by a multitude of attracted yet non-specific T cells. Results from a recent simulation study suggested that the deleterious effect dominates. We re-addressed the question whether T cell chemoattraction towards DCs is expected to promote or hamper the detection of rare antigens using the Cellular Potts Model, a formalism that allows for dynamic, flexible cellular shapes and cell migration. Our simulations show that chemoattraction of T cells enhances the DC scanning efficiency, leading to an increased probability that rare antigen-specific T cells find DCs carrying cognate antigen. Desensitization of T cells after contact with a DC further improves the scanning efficiency, yielding an almost threefold enhancement compared to random migration. Moreover, the chemotaxis-driven migration still roughly appears as a random walk, hence fine-tuned analysis of cell tracks will be required to detect chemotaxis within microscopy data.},

As a consequence, recall is thought to result from a phased response first involving those T cells already at the site of infection followed by the infiltration of memory cells from the wider circulation. We have recently reported that tissue-resident T cells can undergo stimulation and proliferation in response to local infection. In this study, we examine the proliferation of memory T cells newly recruited from the circulation. Our results show that although recruitment of circulating memory cells is nonspecific in nature, there is preferential proliferation of specific T cells within infected tissues. Thus, expansion represents a means of local Ag-specific enrichment of T cells recruited from a circulating memory pool of mixed specificities.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus replicates in the respiratory epithelium and induces an inflammatory infiltrate comprised of mononuclear cells and neutrophils. To understand the development of the cell-mediated immune response to influenza and how leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation is regulated, we examined the chemokine expression pattern in lung tissue from A/PR/8/34-infected C57BL/6 mice using an RNase protection assay. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, MIP-3alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), MIP-2, and interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) mRNA expression was up-regulated between days 5 and 15 after infection, consistent with a role for these chemokines in leukocyte recruitment to the lung. Low levels of expression were detected for the CC chemokine receptors (CCR)2 and CCR5, whereas CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)3 was significantly up-regulated by day 10 after infection, coinciding with peak inflammatory cell infiltration in the airways. As RANTES, IP-10, and their receptors were up-regulated during influenza virus infection, we investigated leukocyte recruitment and viral clearance in mice deficient in RANTES or CXCR3, the receptor for IP-10. Leukocyte recruitment and viral replication in influenza-infected RANTES knockout(-/-) mice were similar to that in control mice, showing that RANTES is not essential for the immune response to influenza infection. Similarly, leukocyte recruitment and viral replication in CXCR3-/- mice were identical to control mice, except at day 8 postinfection, where fewer lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage of CXCR3-/- mice. These studies suggest that although the chemokines detected may play a role in regulating leukocyte trafficking to the lung during influenza infection, some may be functionally redundant.},

abstract = {Influenza is caused by a virus that attacks mainly the upper respiratory tract the nose, throat and bronchi and rarely also the lungs. The infection usually lasts for about a week. It is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, myalgia, headache and severe malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis. Most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment. In the very young, the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases, diabetes, cancer, kidney or heart problems, influenza poses a serious risk. In these people, the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases, pneumonia and death. Influenza rapidly spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics and imposes a considerable economic burden in the form of hospital and other health care costs and lost productivity. In the United States of America, for example, recent estimates put the cost of influenza epidemics to the economy at US 71-167 billion per year. In annual influenza epidemics 5-15\% of the population are affected with upper respiratory tract infections. Hospitalization and deaths mainly occur in high-risk groups (elderly, chronically ill). Although difficult to assess, these annual epidemics are thought to result in between three and five million cases of severe illness and between 250 000 and 500 000 deaths every year around the world. Most deaths currently associated with influenza in industrialized countries occur among the elderly over 65 years of age. Much less is known about the impact of influenza in the developing world. However, influenza outbreaks in the tropics where viral transmission normally continues year-round tend to have high attack and case-fatality rates. For example, during an influenza outbreak in Madagascar in 2002, more than 27 000 cases were reported within three months and 800 deaths occurred despite rapid intervention. An investigation of this outbreak, coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO), found that there were severe health consequences in poorly nourished populations with limited access to adequate health care (see Outbreak of influenza, Madagascar, July-August 2002,Weekly Epidemiological Record,). It is not possible to extrapolate the exact annual burden of influenza in the tropics from data from such occasional and severe outbreaks.},

abstract = {This work ties together two distinct modeling frameworks for population dynamics: an individual-based simulation and a set of coupled integrodifferential equations involving population densities. The simulation model represents an idealized predator-prey system formulated at the scale of discrete individuals, explicitly incorporating their mutual interactions, whereas the population-level framework is a generalized version of reaction-diffusion models that incorporate population densities coupled to one another by interaction rates. Here I use various combinations of long-range dispersal for both the offspring and adult stages of both prey and predator species, providing a broad range of spatial and temporal dynamics, to compare and contrast the two model frameworks. Taking the individual-based modeling results as given, two examinations of the reaction-dispersal model are made: linear stability analysis of the deterministic equations and direct numerical solution of the model equations. I also modify the numerical solution in two ways to account for the stochastic nature of individual-based processes, which include independent, local perturbations in population density and a minimum population density within integration cells, below which the population is set to zero. These modifications introduce new parameters into the population-level model, which I adjust to reproduce the individual-based model results. The individual-based model is then modified to minimize the effects of stochasticity, producing a match of the predictions from the numerical integration of the population-level model without stochasticity.},

abstract = {The biological parameters that determine the distribution of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells during influenza infection are not all directly measurable by experimental techniques but can be inferred through mathematical modeling. Mechanistic and semimechanistic ordinary differential equations were developed to describe the expansion, trafficking, and disappearance of activated virus-specific CD8(+) T cells in lymph nodes, spleens, and lungs of mice during primary influenza A infection. An intensive sampling of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells from these three compartments was used to inform the models. Rigorous statistical fitting of the models to the experimental data allowed estimation of important biological parameters. Although the draining lymph node is the first tissue in which Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells are detected, it was found that the spleen contributes the greatest number of effector CD8(+) T cells to the lung, with rates of expansion and migration that exceeded those of the draining lymph node. In addition, models that were based on the number and kinetics of professional APCs fit the data better than those based on viral load, suggesting that the immune response is limited by Ag presentation rather than the amount of virus. Modeling also suggests that loss of effector T cells from the lung is significant and time dependent, increasing toward the end of the acute response. Together, these efforts provide a better understanding of the primary CD8(+) T cell response to influenza infection, changing the view that the spleen plays a minor role in the primary immune response.},

abstract = {The chemokine, CXCL10, chemotactic for NK cells, activated T cells, and dendritic cells is highly expressed during viral infections, including HSV-1. The importance of this chemokine to the control of HSV-1 infection was tested using mice deficient in CXCL10 (CXCL10(-/-)). Following corneal infection, HSV-1 viral titers were elevated in the nervous system of CXCL10(-/-) mice, which correlated with defects in leukocyte recruitment including dendritic cells, NK cells, and HSV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells to the brain stem. In the absence of NK cells and HSV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells in wild-type (WT) or CXCL10(-/-) mice, similar levels of virus were recovered in the nervous system, suggesting these cells are responsible for the observed defects in the control of viral replication in CXCL10(-/-) mice. Leukocyte mobilization was also compared between WT, CXCL10(-/-), and mice deficient in the only known receptor for CXCL10, CXCR3 (CXCR3 (-/-)). NK cell mobilization was comparably reduced in both CXCL10(-/-) and CXCR3(-/-) mice relative to WT animals. However, the reduction in mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells in CXCL10(-/-) was not observed in CXCR3(-/-) mice following HSV-1 infection. The defect was not the result of an alternative receptor for CXCL10, as Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell recruitment was not reduced in mice which were deficient in both CXCL10 and CXCR3. Thus, CXCL10 deficiency results in reduced mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells as a result of dysregulation of CXCR3 signaling.},

abstract = {The unparalleled spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 viruses has resulted in devastating outbreaks in domestic poultry and sporadic human infections with a high fatality rate. To better understand the mechanism(s) of H5N1 virus pathogenesis and host responses in humans, we utilized a polarized human bronchial epithelial cell model that expresses both avian alpha-2,3- and human alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors on the apical surface and supports productive replication of both H5N1 and H3N2 viruses. Using this model, we compared the abilities of selected 2004 HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from humans and a recent human H3N2 virus to trigger the type I interferon (IFN) response. H5N1 viruses elicited significantly less IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) nuclear translocation, as well as delayed and reduced production of IFN-beta compared with the H3N2 virus. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Stat2 and induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as MX1, ISG15, IRF7, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I, were substantially delayed and reduced in cells infected with H5N1 viruses. We also observed that the highly virulent H5N1 virus replicated more efficiently and induced a weaker IFN response than the H5N1 virus that exhibited low virulence in mammals in an earlier study. Our data suggest that the H5N1 viruses tested, especially the virus with the high-pathogenicity phenotype, possess greater capability to attenuate the type I IFN response than the human H3N2 virus. The attenuation of this critical host innate immune defense may contribute to the virulence of H5N1 viruses observed in humans.},

abstract = {The pandemic H1N1 virus of 2009 (2009 H1N1) produced a spectrum of disease ranging from mild illness to severe illness and death. Respiratory symptoms were frequently associated with virus infection, with relatively high rate of gastrointestinal symptoms reported. To better understand 2009 H1N1 virus pathogenesis in humans, we studied virus and host responses following infection of two cell types: polarized bronchial and pharyngeal epithelial cells, which exhibit many features of the human airway epithelium, and colon epithelial cells to serve as a human intestinal cell model. Selected 2009 H1N1 viruses were compared to both seasonal H1N1 and triple-reassortant swine H1N1 influenza viruses that have circulated among North American pigs since before the 2009 pandemic. All H1N1 viruses replicated productively in airway cells; however, in contrast to seasonal H1N1 virus infection, infection with the 2009 H1N1 and triple-reassortant swine H1N1 viruses resulted in an attenuated inflammatory response, a weaker interferon response, and reduced cell death. Additionally, the H1N1 viruses of swine origin replicated less efficiently at the temperature of the human proximal airways (33C). We also observed that the 2009 H1N1 viruses replicated to significantly higher titers than seasonal H1N1 virus in polarized colon epithelial cells. These studies reveal that in comparison to seasonal influenza virus, H1N1 viruses of swine origin poorly activate multiple aspects of the human innate response, which may contribute to the virulence of these viruses. In addition, their less efficient replication at human upper airway temperatures has implications for the understanding of pandemic H1N1 virus adaptation to humans.},

abstract = {CD8+ T lymphocyte responses are a critical arm of the immune response to respiratory virus infection and may play a role in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease. We have shown that CD8+ T cells induce significant lung injury in the absence of virus infection by adoptive transfer into mice with alveolar expression of a viral transgene. The injury is characterized by the parenchymal infiltration of host cells, primarily macrophages, which correlates with physiologic deficits in transgenic animals. CD8+ T cellmediated lung injury can occur in the absence of perforin and Fas expression as long as TNF-$\alpha$ is available. Here, we show that the effect of TNF-$\alpha$ expressed by CD8+ T cells is mediated not exclusively by cytotoxicity, but also through the activation of alveolar target cells and their expression of inflammatory mediators. CD8+ T cell recognition of alveolar cells in vitro triggered monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) expression in the targets, which was mediated by TNF-$\alpha$. Antigen-dependent alveolar MCP-1 expression was observed in vivo as early as 3 hours after CD8+ T cell transfer and depended upon TNF-R1 expression in transgenic recipients. MCP-1 neutralization significantly reduced parenchymal infiltration after T cell transfer. We conclude that alveolar epithelial cells actively participate in the inflammation and lung injury associated with CD8+ T cell recognition of alveolar antigens.

abstract = {T lymphocytes (T cells) express T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules on their surface that can recognize peptides (p) derived from antigenic proteins bound to products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The pMHC molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). T cells first encounter antigen on DCs in lymph nodes (LN). Intravital microscopy experiments show that upon entering the LN containing antigen, CD8+ T cells first move rapidly. After a few hours, they stop and make extended contacts with DCs. The factors that determine when and how this transition occurs are not well understood. We report results from computer simulations that suggest that the duration of phase one is related to the low probability of productive interactions between T cells and DCs. This is demonstrated by our finding that the antigen dose and type determine when such a transition occurs. These results are in agreement with experimental observations. TCR-pMHC binding characteristics and the antigen dose determine the time required for a productive T-cell-DC encounter (resulting in sustained contact). We find that the ratio of this time scale and the half-life of the pMHC complex itself provide a consolidated measure of antigen quantity and type. Results obtained upon varying different measures of antigen quantity and type fall on one curve when graphed against this ratio of time scales. Thus, we provide a mechanism for how the effects of varying one set of parameters are influenced by other prevailing conditions. This understanding should help guide future experimentation.},

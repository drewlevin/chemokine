abstract = {Skin dendritic cells (DCs) are thought to act as key initiators of local T cell immunity. Here we show that after skin infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation required MHC class I-restricted presentation by nonmigratory CD8(+) DCs rather than skin-derived DCs. Despite a lack of direct presentation by migratory DCs, blocking their egress from infected skin substantially inhibited class I-restricted presentation and HSV-specific CTL responses. These results support the argument for initial transport of antigen by migrating DCs, followed by its transfer to the lymphoid-resident DCs for presentation and CTL priming. Given that relatively robust CTL responses were seen with small numbers of skin-emigrant DCs, we propose that this inter-DC antigen transfer functions to amplify presentation across a larger network of lymphoid-resident DCs for efficient T cell activation.},

abstract = {Bronchiolar epithelial cells are the prime targets for influenza A virus infection. It still remains to be clarified which signals are generated from these cells to initiate an immune response. Among chemokines, viral infection of primary lung epithelial cells triggered exclusively the release of CXCL8/interleukin-8 (IL-8), which contrasts with our previous observation that influenza A virus induced in monocytes the expression of mononuclear-leukocyte-attracting chemokines and even suppressed the production of neutrophil-attracting chemokines. Therefore, we speculated that it may be advantageous for respiratory epithelial cells to release primarily neutrophil-attracting CXCL8/IL-8 since neutrophils rapidly remove necrotic debris and are the first line of defense against bacterial superinfections. This concept has also been supported by our finding that influenza A virus infection led to necrosis of lung epithelial cells. This is in striking contrast to previous studies where influenza A virus infection induced apoptosis in monocytes and epithelial cells from origins other than the lung. Thus, the cell type instead of the virus determines which death pathway will be followed. In addition to the release of CXCL8/IL-8, we obtained a massive release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) from virus-infected lung cells. However, whereas the CXCL8/IL-8 secretion was accompanied by induced gene activation, the transcription rate of MIF remained unchanged during the infection course and the virus-induced MIF release was predominantly a discharge from intracellular stores, suggesting that MIF is passively released upon cell death. Despite virus induced necrosis, the passively liberated MIF remained bioactive. Considering the well-established immunostimulatory effects of MIF on different leukocyte subsets, is its very likely that enhanced levels of MIF may contribute to the host immune response during the acute phase of influenza A virus infection in humans.},

abstract = {In the early phases of an immune response, T cells of appropriate antigen specificity become activated by antigen-presenting cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Two-photon microscopy imaging experiments have shown that this stimulation occurs in distinct stages during which T cells exhibit different motilities and interactions with dendritic cells (DCs). In this paper, we utilize the Cellular Potts Model, a model formalism that takes cell shapes and cellular interactions explicitly into account, to simulate the dynamics of, and interactions between, T cells and DCs in the lymph node paracortex. Our three-dimensional simulations suggest that the initial decrease in T-cell motility after antigen appearance is due to "stop signals" transmitted by activated DCs to T cells. The long-lived interactions that occur at a later stage can only be explained by the presence of both stop signals and a high adhesion between specific T cells and antigen-bearing DCs. Furthermore, our results indicate that long-lasting contacts with T cells are promoted when DCs retract dendrites that detect a specific contact at lower velocities than other dendrites. Finally, by performing long simulations (after prior fitting to short time scale data) we are able to provide an estimate of the average contact duration between T cells and DCs.},

abstract = {CD8+ T cells have a crucial role in resistance to pathogens and can kill malignant cells; however, some critical functions of these lymphocytes depend on helper activity provided by a distinct population of CD4+ T cells. Cooperation between these lymphocyte subsets involves recognition of antigens co-presented by the same dendritic cell, but the frequencies of such antigen-bearing cells early in an infection and of the relevant naive T cells are both low. This suggests that an active mechanism facilitates the necessary cell-cell associations. Here we demonstrate that after immunization but before antigen recognition, naive CD8+ T cells in immunogen-draining lymph nodes upregulate the chemokine receptor CCR5, permitting these cells to be attracted to sites of antigen-specific dendritic cell-CD4+ T cell interaction where the cognate chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 (also known as MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta) are produced. Interference with this actively guided recruitment markedly reduces the ability of CD4+ T cells to promote memory CD8+ T-cell generation, indicating that an orchestrated series of differentiation events drives nonrandom cell-cell interactions within lymph nodes, optimizing CD8+ T-cell immune responses involving the few antigen-specific precursors present in the naive repertoire.},

Here we have used a combination of flow cytometry, 2-photon imaging, and computational modeling to quantify the probability of T cell-DC encounters. We calculated that the chance for a T cell residing 24 hours in a murine popliteal lymph nodes to interact with a DC was 8\%, 58\%, and 99\% in the presence of 10, 100, and 1000 Ag-bearing DCs, respectively. Our results reveal the existence of a threshold in DC numbers below which T-cell responses fail to be elicited for probabilistic reasons. In mice and probably humans, we estimate that a minimum of 85 DCs are required to initiate a T-cell response when starting from precursor frequency of 10(-6). Our results have implications for the rational design of DC-based vaccines.},

Here we investigated the protective value of defined in vitrogenerated hemagglutinin (HA) peptide-specific primary CD8 T cell effectors from the clone 4 T cell receptor transgenic mice, secreting type 1 or type 2 cytokines, against pulmonary infection with whole influenza virus. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes producing type 1 and type 2 cytokine (Tc1 and Tc2) populations were equally cytolytic, but Tc1 effectors and not Tc2 effectors reduced the pulmonary virus titer early during infection. Host recovery mediated by Tc1 effectors was found to be independent of interferon $\gamma$ production. Tc2 effectors entered the lung with delayed kinetics as compared with Tc1 effectors, and after lung entry Tc2 effector cells did not localize near the infected airway epithelium as did Tc1 effectors but were found within clusters of inflammatory cells distant from the epithelium. We also show that the expression of several chemokine receptors was selectively regulated in the Tc1 and Tc2 subsets. Thus, the protective value of a CD8 cell population against pulmonary influenza virus infection is strongly correlated with its ability to exert its effector potential at the site of virus infection.},

abstract = {Background: Fatal human respiratory disease associated with influenza A subtype H5N1 has been documented in Hong Kong, and more recently in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. We previously demonstrated that patients with H5N1 disease had unusually high serum levels of IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10). Furthermore, when compared with human influenza virus subtype H1N1, the H5N1 viruses in 1997 (A/Hong Kong/483/97) (H5N1/97) were more potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-a) and chemokines (e.g. IP-10) from primary human macrophages in vitro, which suggests that cytokines dysregulation may play a role in pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. Since respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target cell for replication of influenza viruses, it is pertinent to investigate the cytokine induction profile of H5N1 viruses in these cells. Methods: We used quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA to compare the profile of cytokine and chemokine gene expression induced by H5N1 viruses A/HK/483/97 (H5N1/97), A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04 (both H5N1/04) with that of human H1N1 virus in human primary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Results: We demonstrated that in comparison to human H1N1 viruses, H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses were more potent inducers of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in primary human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Recent H5N1 viruses from Vietnam (H5N1/04) appeared to be even more potent at inducing IP-10 than H5N1/97 virus. Conclusion: The H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human respiratory epithelial cells than subtype H1N1 virus. We suggest that this hyper-induction of cytokines may be relevant to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease.},

abstract = {Influenza H5N1 virus continues to be enzootic in poultry and transmits zoonotically to humans. Although a swine-origin H1N1 virus has emerged to become pandemic, its virulence for humans remains modest in comparison to that seen in zoonotic H5N1 disease. As human respiratory epithelium is the primary target cells for influenza viruses, elucidating the viral tropism and host innate immune responses of influenza H5N1 virus in human bronchial epithelium may help to understand the pathogenesis. Here we established primary culture of undifferentiated and well differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and infected with highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 virus (A/Vietnam/3046/2004) and a seasonal influenza H1N1 virus (A/Hong Kong/54/1998), the viral replication kinetics and cytokine and chemokine responses were compared by qPCR and ELISA. We found that the in vitro culture of the well differentiated NHBE cells acquired the physiological properties of normal human bronchi tissue which express high level of $\alpha$2-6-linked sialic acid receptors and human airway trypsin-like (HAT) protease, in contrast to the low expression in the non-differentiated NHBE cells. When compared to H1N1 virus, the H5N1 virus replicated more efficiently and induced a stronger type I interferon response in the undifferentiated NHBE cells. In contrast, in well differentiated cultures, H5N1 virus replication was less efficient and elicited a lower interferon-beta response in comparison with H1N1 virus. Our data suggest that the differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells has a major influence in cells' permissiveness to human H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses and the host innate immune responses. The reduced virus replication efficiency partially accounts for the lower interferon-beta responses in influenza H5N1 virus infected well differentiated NHBE cells. Since influenza infection in the bronchial epithelium will lead to tissue damage and associate with the epithelium regeneration, the data generated from the undifferentiated NHBE cultures may also be relevant to disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10/CXCL10 is a chemokine associated with type 1 T cell responses, regulating the migration of activated T cells through binding to the CXCR3 receptor. Expression of both CXCL10 and CXCR3 are observed during immunopathological diseases of the CNS, and this receptor/ligand pair is thought to play a central role in regulating T cell-mediated inflammation in this organ site. In this report, we investigated the role of CXCL10 in regulating CD8(+) T cell-mediated inflammation in the virus-infected brain. This was done through analysis of CXCL10-deficient mice infected intracerebrally with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which in normal immunocompetent mice induces a fatal CD8(+) T cell-mediated meningoencephalitis. We found that a normal antiviral CD8(+) T cell response was generated in CXCL10-deficient mice, and that lack of CXCL10 had no influence on the accumulation of mononuclear cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, analysis of the susceptibility of CXCL10-deficient mice to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-induced meningitis revealed that these mice just like CXCR3-deficient mice were partially resistant to this disease, whereas wild-type mice invariably died. Furthermore, despite marked up-regulation of the two remaining CXCR3 ligands: CXCL9 and 11, we found a reduced accumulation of CD8(+) T cells in the brain parenchyma around the time point when wild-type mice succumb as a result of CD8(+) T cell-mediated inflammation. Thus, taken together these results indicate a central role for CXCL10 in regulating the accumulation of effector T cells at sites of CNS inflammation, with no apparent compensatory effect of other CXCR3 ligands.},

abstract = {T-cells play an important role in controlling viral infections inside the CNS. To study the role of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 in the migration and positioning of virus-specific effector T-cells within the brain, CXCR3-deficient mice were infected intracerebrally with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Analysis of the induction phase of the antiviral CD8+ T-cell response did not reveal any immune defects in CXCR3-deficient mice. Yet, when mice were challenged with LCMV intracerebrally, most CXCR3-deficient mice survived the infection, whereas wild-type mice invariably died from CD8+ T-cell-mediated immunopathology. Quantitative analysis of the cellular infiltrate in CSF of infected mice revealed modest, if any, decrease in the number of mononuclear cells recruited to the meninges in the absence of CXCR3. However, immunohistological analysis disclosed a striking impairment of CD8+ T-cells from CXCR3-deficient mice to migrate from the meninges into the outer layers of the brain parenchyma despite similar localization of virus-infected target cells. Reconstitution of CXCR3-deficient mice with wild-type CD8+ T-cells completely restored susceptibility to LCMV-induced meningitis. Thus, taken together, our results strongly point to a critical role for CXCR3 in the positioning of effector T-cells at sites of viral inflammation in the brain.},

abstract = {The primary CD8 T cell immune response constitutes a major mechanism to fight an infection by intra-cellular pathogens. We aim at assessing whether pathogen-specific dynamical parameters of the CD8 T cell response can be identified, based on measurements of CD8 T cell counts, using a modeling approach. We generated experimental data consisting in CD8 T cell counts kinetics during the response to three different live intra-cellular pathogens: two viruses (influenza, vaccinia) injected intranasally, and one bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes) injected intravenously. All pathogens harbor the same antigen (NP68), but differ in their interaction with the host. In parallel, we developed a mathematical model describing the evolution of CD8 T cell counts and pathogen amount during an immune response. This model is characterized by 9 parameters and includes relevant feedback controls. The model outputs were compared with the three data series and an exhaustive estimation of the parameter values was performed. By focusing on the ability of the model to fit experimental data and to produce a CD8 T cell population mainly composed of memory cells at the end of the response, critical parameters were identified. We show that a small number of parameters (2–4) define the main features of the CD8 T cell immune response and are characteristic of a given pathogen. Among these parameters, two are related to the effector CD8 T cell mediated control of cell and pathogen death. The parameter associated with memory cell death is shown to play no relevant role during the main phases of the CD8 T cell response, yet it becomes essential when looking at the predictions of the model several months after the infection.},

abstract = {The adaptive immune system relies on different cell types to provide fast and coordinated responses, characterized by recognition of pathogenic challenge, extensive cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as death. T cells are a subset of the adaptive immune cellular pool that recognize immunogenic peptides expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells by means of specialized receptors on their membrane. T cell receptor binding to ligand determines T cell responses at different times and locations during the life of a T cell. Current experimental evidence provides support to the following: (i) sufficiently long receptor-ligand engagements are required to initiate the T cell signalling cascade that results in productive signal transduction and (ii) counting devices are at work in T cells to allow signal accumulation, decoding and translation into biological responses. In the light of these results, we explore, with mathematical models, the timescales associated with T cell responses. We consider two different criteria: a stochastic one (the mean time it takes to have had N receptor-ligand complexes bound for at least a dwell time, $\tau$, each) and one based on equilibrium (the time to reach a threshold number N of receptor-ligand complexes). We have applied mathematical models to previous experiments in the context of thymic negative selection and to recent two-dimensional experiments. Our results indicate that the stochastic criterion provides support to the thymic affinity threshold hypothesis, whereas the equilibrium one does not, and agrees with the ligand hierarchy experimentally established for thymic negative selection.},

abstract = {The immune response to influenza A virus is characterized by an influx of both macrophages and T lymphocytes into the lungs of the infected host, accompanied by induced expression of a number of CC chemokines. CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 are both expressed on activated macrophages and T cells. We examined how the absence of these chemokine receptors would affect pulmonary chemokine expression and induced leukocyte recruitment by infecting CCR5-deficient mice and CCR2-deficient mice with a mouse-adapted strain of influenza A virus. CCR5(-/-) mice displayed increased mortality rates associated with acute, severe pneumonitis, whereas CCR2(-/-) mice were protected from the early pathological manifestations of influenza because of defective macrophage recruitment. This delay in macrophage accumulation in CCR2(-/-) mice caused a subsequent delay in T cell migration, which correlated with high pulmonary viral titers at early time points. Infected CCR5(-/-) mice and CCR2(-/-) mice both exhibited increased expression of the gene for MCP-1, the major ligand for CCR2(-/-) and a key regulator of induced macrophage migration. These studies illustrate the very different roles that CCR5 and CCR2 play in the macrophage response to influenza infection and demonstrate how defects in macrophage recruitment affect the normal development of the cell-mediated immune response.},

abstract = {Avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses cause severe disease in humans, but the basis for their virulence remains unclear. In vitro and animal studies indicate that high and disseminated viral replication is important for disease pathogenesis. Laboratory experiments suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation may contribute to disease severity. To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood. Viral RNA in blood was present only in fatal H5N1 cases and was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. We observed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with pharyngeal viral loads. Genetic characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed mutations in the viral polymerase complex associated with mammalian adaptation and virulence. Our observations indicate that high viral load, and the resulting intense inflammatory responses, are central to influenza H5N1 pathogenesis. The focus of clinical management should be on preventing this intense cytokine response, by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment.},

abstract = {T cells play a key role in the control of viral infection in the CNS but may also contribute to immune-mediated cell damage. To study the redundancy of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 in regulating virus-induced CD8+ T cell-mediated inflammation in the brain, CXCR3/CCR5 double-deficient mice were generated and infected intracerebrally with noncytolytic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Because these chemokine receptors are mostly expressed by overlapping subsets of activated CD8+ T cells, it was expected that absence of both receptors would synergistically impair effector T cell invasion and therefore protect mice against the otherwise fatal CD8+ T cell-mediated immune attack. Contrary to expectations, the accumulation of mononuclear cells in cerebrospinal fluid was only slightly delayed compared with mice with normal expression of both receptors. Even more surprising, CXCR3/CCR5 double-deficient mice were more susceptible to intracerebral infection than CXCR3-deficient mice. Analysis of effector T cell generation revealed an accelerated antiviral CD8+ T cell response in CXCR3/CCR5 double-deficient mice. Furthermore, while the accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the neural parenchyma was significantly delayed in both CXCR3- and CXCR3/CCR5-deficient mice, more CD8+ T cells were found in the parenchyma of double-deficient mice when these were analyzed around the time when the difference in clinical outcome becomes manifest. Taken together, these results indicate that while CXCR3 plays an important role in controlling CNS inflammation, other receptors but not CCR5 also contribute significantly. Additionally, our results suggest that CCR5 primarily functions as a negative regulator of the antiviral CD8+ T cell response.},

abstract = {In humans, the elderly and immunocompromised are at greatest risk for disseminated West Nile virus (WNV) infection, yet the immunologic basis for this remains unclear. We demonstrated previously that B cells and IgG contributed to the defense against disseminated WNV infection (Diamond, M.S., B. Shrestha, A. Marri, D. Mahan, and M. Engle. 2003. J. Virol. 77:25782586). In this paper, we addressed the function of IgM in controlling WNV infection. C57BL/6J mice (sIgM/) that were deficient in the production of secreted IgM but capable of expressing surface IgM and secreting other immunoglobulin isotypes were vulnerable to lethal infection, even after inoculation with low doses of WNV. Within 96 h, markedly higher levels of infectious virus were detected in the serum of sIgM/ mice compared with wild-type mice. The enhanced viremia correlated with higher WNV burdens in the central nervous system, and was also associated with a blunted anti-WNV IgG response. Passive transfer of polyclonal anti-WNV IgM or IgG protected sIgM/ mice against mortality, although administration of comparable amounts of a nonneutralizing monoclonal anti-WNV IgM provided no protection. In a prospective analysis, a low titer of anti-WNV IgM antibodies at day 4 uniformly predicted mortality in wild-type mice. Thus, the induction of a specific, neutralizing IgM response early in the course of WNV infection limits viremia and dissemination into the central nervous system, and protects against lethal infection.},

Here we investigate relationships among antigen presentation, T cell motility, and local production of effector cytokines by CD4+ T cells within hepatic granulomas triggered by Bacille Calmette-Gu\'{e}rin or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. At steady-state, only small fractions of mycobacteria-specific T cells showed antigen-induced migration arrest within granulomas, resulting in low-level, polarized secretion of cytokines. However, exogenous antigen elicited rapid arrest and robust cytokine production by the vast majority of effector T cells. These findings suggest that limited antigen presentation and/or recognition within granulomas evoke a muted T cell response drawing on only a fraction of the host's potential effector capacity. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of host-protective functions, especially how antigen availability influences T cell dynamics and, in turn, effector T cell function during chronic infection.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a cell culture model of human alveolar epithelial cells in primary culture for the in vitro study of pulmonary absorption and transport. METHODS: Type II pneumocytes isolated from normal human distal lung tissue by enzyme treatment and subsequent purification were plated on fibronectin/collagen coated polyester filter inserts, and cultured using a low-serum growth medium. Characterization of the cell culture was achieved by bioelectric measurements, cell-specific lectin binding, immunohistochemical detection of cell junctions, and by assessment of transepithelial transport of dextrans of varying molecular weights. RESULTS: In culture, the isolated cells spread into confluent monolayers, exhibiting peak transepithelial resistance of 2,180 62 ohms x cm2 and potential difference of 13.5 1.0 mV (n = 30-48), and developing tight junctions as well as desmosomes. As assessed by lectin-binding, the cell monolayers consisted of mainly type I cells with some interspersed type II cells, thus well mimicking the situation in vivo. The permeability of hydrophilic macromolecular FITC-dextrans across the cell monolayer was found to be inversely related to their molecular size, with Papp values ranging from 1.7 to 0.2 x 10(-8) cm/sec. CONCLUSIONS: A primary cell culture model of human alveolar epithelial cells has been established, which appears to be a valuable in vitro model for pulmonary drug delivery and transport studies.},

abstract = {Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells, and play a critical role in immune protection. Our knowledge of how the CTL killing efficiency varies with CTL and target cell numbers is limited. Here, we simulate a region of lymphoid tissue using a cellular Potts model to characterize the functional response of CTL killing of target cells, and find that the total killing rate saturates both with the CTL and the target cell densities. The relative saturation in CTL and target cell densities is determined by whether a CTL can kill multiple target cells at the same time, and whether a target cell can be killed by many CTLs together. We find that all the studied regimes can be well described by a double-saturation (DS) function with two different saturation constants. We show that this DS model can be mechanistically derived for the cases where target cells are killed by a single CTL. For the other cases, a biological interpretation of the parameters is still possible. Our results imply that this DS function can be used as a tool to predict the cellular interactions in cytotoxicity data. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in immunology, several key parameters determining virus dynamics in infected hosts remain largely unknown. For example, the rate at which specific effector and memory CD8 T cells clear virus-infected cells in vivo is hardly known for any viral infection. We propose a framework to quantify T-cell-mediated killing of infected or peptide-pulsed target cells using the widely used in vivo cytotoxicity assay. We have reanalyzed recently published data on killing of peptide-pulsed splenocytes by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and memory CD8 T cells specific to NP396 and GP276 epitopes of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in the mouse spleen. Because there are so many effector CD8 T cells in spleens of mice at the peak of the immune response, NP396- and GP276-pulsed targets are estimated to have very short half-lives of 2 and 14 min, respectively. After the effector numbers have diminished, i.e., in LCMV-immune mice, the half-lives become 48 min and 2.8 h for NP396- and GP276-expressing targets, respectively. Analysis of several alternative models demonstrates that the estimates of half-life times of peptide-pulsed targets are not affected when changes are made in the model assumptions. Our report provides a unifying framework to compare killing efficacies of CD8 T-cell responses specific to different viral and bacterial infections in vivo, which may be used to compare efficacies of various cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-based vaccines.},

abstract = {CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor that is rapidly induced on na\"{\i}ve T cells following activation, and preferentially remains highly expressed on type-1 helper (Th1)-type CD4(+) T cells, effector CD8(+) T cells and innate-type lymphocytes, such as natural killer (NK) and NKT cells. CXCR3 is activated by three interferon (IFN)-$\gamma$-inducible ligands CXCL9 (monokine induced by gamma-interferon), CXCL10 (interferon-induced protein-10) and CXCL11 (interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant). Although some studies have revealed that these ligands have redundant functions in vivo, other studies have demonstrated that the three CXCR3 ligands can also collaborate and even compete with each other. Differential regulation of the three ligands at specific times in defined anatomically restricted locations in vivo likely participates in the fine control of T-cell trafficking over the course of an immune response. Among the differences in regulation, CXCL10 is induced by a variety of innate stimuli that induce IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$ as well as the adaptive immune cell cytokine IFN-$\gamma$, whereas CXCL9 induction is restricted to IFN-$\gamma$. In this review, we will discuss how the balance, timing and pattern of CXCR3 ligand expression appears to regulate the generation of effector T cells in the lymphoid compartment and subsequent migration into peripheral sites of Th1-type inflammation in which the CXCR3 ligands also then regulate the interactions and migratory behavior of effector T cells in an inflamed peripheral tissue.},

abstract = {Preferential homing of naive lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs is thought to involve the action of chemokines, yet no chemokine has been shown to have either the expression pattern or the activities required to mediate this process. Here we show that a chemokine represented in the EST database, secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (SLC), is expressed in the high endothelial venules of lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, in the T cell areas of spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches, and in the lymphatic endothelium of multiple organs. SLC is a highly efficacious chemoattractant for lymphocytes with preferential activity toward naive T cells. Moreover, SLC induces firm adhesion of naive T lymphocytes via beta2 integrin binding to the counter receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, a necessary step for lymphocyte recruitment. SLC is the first chemokine demonstrated to have the characteristics required to mediate homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, the expression of SLC in lymphatic endothelium suggests that the migration of lymphocytes from tissues into efferent lymphatics may be an active process mediated by this molecule.},

abstract = {Understanding immunodominance, the phenomenon of epitope-specific T cells expanding in an often distinctly hierarchical fashion, is important for the design of T-cell-based intervention strategies. Several recent studies have investigated immunodominance of H-2Db-restricted CD8+ T cells specific for the nucleoprotein NP366 and acid polymerase PA224 epitopes during influenza A virus infection of C57BL/6 mice. CD8+ T cells specific for these two epitopes are codominant during primary infection; NP366 dominates during secondary infection. While a number of explanations for this observation have been proposed, none of them can fully account for all the observed data. In this article, we use a simple mathematical model to explain the seemingly inconsistent data. We show that the dynamic interactions between CD8+ T cells and antigen presentation lead to a situation where CD8+ T cells are limiting during the initial response whereas antigen is limiting in the secondary response. This numbers game between antigen and CD8+ T cells can reproduce the observed immunodominance of the NP336- and PA224-specific CD8+ T cells, thereby explaining the reported experimental data.},

abstract = {We examined the extent to which CXCR3 mediates resistance to dengue infection. Following intracerebral infection with dengue virus, CXCR3-deficient (CXCR3(-/-)) mice showed significantly higher mortality rates than wild-type (WT) mice; moreover, surviving CXCR3(-/-) mice, but not WT mice, often developed severe hind-limb paralysis. The brains of CXCR3(-/-) mice showed higher viral loads than those of WT mice, and quantitative analysis using real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry revealed fewer T cells, CD8(+) T cells in particular, in the brains of CXCR3(-/-) mice. This suggests that recruitment of effector T cells to sites of dengue infection was diminished in CXCR3(-/-) mice, which impaired elimination of the virus from the brain and thus increased the likelihood of paralysis and/or death. These results indicate that CXCR3 plays a protective rather than an immunopathological role in dengue virus infection. In studies to identify critical CXCR3 ligands, CXCL10/IFN-inducible protein 10-deficient (CXCL10/IP-10(-/-)) mice infected with dengue virus showed a higher mortality rate than that of the CXCR3(-/-) mice. Although CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL9/monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and CXCL11/IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant share a single receptor and all three of these chemokines are induced by dengue virus infection, the latter two could not compensate for the absence of CXCL10/IP-10 in this in vivo model. Our results suggest that both CXCR3 and CXCL10/IP-10 contribute to resistance against primary dengue virus infection and that chemokines that are indistinguishable in in vitro assays differ in their activities in vivo.},

We found that Ag presentation by DCs occurs strictly in the draining lymph nodes and not within the lung itself. Surprisingly, Ag presentation was found to be mediated by a CD11b(+) DC population. Finally, the expression of antigenic complexes on DCs correlated with the location and timing of CD8 T cell activation. These results have implications for approaches to control influenza A virus infection.},

Even though it is a potential means to regulate the size, quality, and duration of a tissue infiltrate, T cell egress from infected tissues is poorly understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, we found that CD8 effector T cells egressed from the infected lung in a CCR7-dependent manner. In contrast, following antigen recognition, effector CD8 T cell egress decreased and CCR7 function was reduced in vivo and in vitro, indicating that the exit of CD8 T cells from infected tissues is tightly regulated. Our data suggest that the regulation of T cell egress is a mechanism to retain antigen-specific effectors at the site of infection to promote viral clearance, while decreasing the numbers of bystander T cells and preventing overt inflammation.},

Here we demonstrate that in response to WNV infection, neurons secrete the chemokine CXCL10, which recruits effector T cells via the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Neutralization or a genetic deficiency of CXCL10 leads to a decrease in CXCR3+ CD8+ T-cell trafficking, an increase in viral burden in the brain, and enhanced morbidity and mortality. These data support a new paradigm in chemokine neurobiology, as neurons are not generally considered to generate antiviral immune responses, and CXCL10 may represent a novel neuroprotective agent in response to WNV infection in the central nervous system.},

Although it was previously reported that the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 affect trafficking of respiratory virus-specific CD8+ T cells, it is unclear whether these receptors govern effector CD4+ T cell migration to the lungs. To assess the role of CCR5 and CXCR3 in vivo, we directly compared the migration of Ag-specific wild-type and chemokine receptor-deficient effector T cells in mixed bone marrow chimeric mice during a parainfluenza virus infection. CXCR3-deficient effector CD4+ T cells were 5- to 10-fold less efficient at migrating to the lung compared with wild-type cells, whereas CCR5-deficient effector T cells were not impaired in their migration to the lung. In contrast to its role in trafficking, CXCR3 had no impact on effector CD4+ T cell proliferation, phenotype, or function in any of the tissues examined. These findings demonstrate that CXCR3 controls virus-specific effector CD4+ T cell migration in vivo, and suggest that blocking CXCR3-mediated recruitment may limit T cell-induced immunopathology during respiratory virus infections.},

abstract = {The development of T cell memory from naive precursors is influenced by molecular cues received during T cell activation and differentiation. In this study, we describe a novel role for the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 in regulating effector CD8(+) T cell contraction and memory generation after influenza virus infection. We find that Ccr5(-/-) Cxcr3(-/-) cells show markedly decreased contraction after viral clearance, leading to the establishment of massive numbers of memory CD8(+) T cells. Ccr5(-/-) Cxcr3(-/-) cells show reduced expression of CD69 in the lung during the peak of infection, which coincides with differential localization and the rapid appearance of memory precursor cells. Analysis of single chemokine receptor-deficient cells revealed that CXCR3 is primarily responsible for this phenotype, although there is also a role for CCR5 in the enhancement of T cell memory. The phenotype could be reversed by adding exogenous antigen, resulting in the activation and contraction of Ccr5(-/-) Cxcr3(-/-) cells. Similar results were observed during chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Together, the data support a model of memory CD8(+) T cell generation in which the chemokine-directed localization of T cells within infected tissues regulates antigen encounter and controls the extent of CD8(+) T cell activation and differentiation, which ultimately regulates effector versus memory cell fate decisions.},

The fidelity of the model is demonstrated by accurately confirming the role of CD4 help for antibody persistence and the consequences of immune depletion experiments. The model predicts that drugs to limit viral infection and/or production must be administered within 2 days of infection, with a benefit of combination therapy when administered early, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells in the lung are as effective for viral clearance as neutralizing antibodies when present at the time of challenge. The model can be used to investigate explicit biological scenarios and generate experimentally testable hypotheses. For example, when the adaptive response depends on cellular immune cell priming, regulation of antigen presentation has greater influence on the kinetics of viral clearance than the efficiency of virus neutralization or cellular cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that the modulation of antigen presentation or the number of lung resident cytotoxic cells and the combination drug intervention are strategies to combat highly virulent influenza viruses. We further compared alternative model structures, for example, B-cell activation directly by the virus versus that through professional antigen-presenting cells or dendritic cell licensing of CD8 T cells.},

abstract = {Although a wealth of knowledge about chemotaxis has accumulated in the past 40 years, these studies have been hampered by the inability of researchers to generate simple linear gradients instantaneously and to maintain them at steady state. Here we describe a device microfabricated by soft lithography and consisting of a network of microfluidic channels that can generate spatially and temporally controlled gradients of chemotactic factors. When human neutrophils are positioned within a microchannel, their migration in simple and complex interleukin-8 (IL-8) gradients can be tested. The cells exhibit strong directional migration toward increasing concentrations of IL-8 in linear gradients. Neutrophil migration halts abruptly when cells encounter a sudden drop in the chemoattractant concentration to zero ("cliff" gradient). When neutrophils are challenged with a gradual increase and decrease in chemoattractant ("hill" gradient), however, the cells traverse the crest of maximum concentration and migrate further before reversing direction. The technique described in this paper provides a robust method to investigate migratory cells under a variety of conditions not accessible to study by earlier techniques.},

We investigated the parameters that affect the migration of subcutaneously injected mouse-mature DCs to the draining lymph node. We found that the efficiency of DC migration varied with the number of injected DCs and that CCR7+/+ DCs migrating to the draining lymph node, but not CCR7-/- DCs that failed to do so, efficiently induced a rapid increase in lymph node cellularity, which was observed before the onset of T cell proliferation. We also report that DC migration could be increased up to 10-fold by preinjection of inflammatory cytokines that increased the expression of the CCR7 ligand CCL21 in lymphatic endothelial cells. The magnitude and quality of CD4+ T cell response was proportional to the number of antigen-carrying DCs that reached the lymph node and could be boosted up to 40-fold by preinjection of tumor necrosis factor that conditioned the tissue for increased DC migration. These results indicate that DC number and tissue inflammation are critical parameters for DC-based vaccination.},

abstract = {Bronchial epithelial cells are primary sites of airway viral infection, and these cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases. It has recently been reported that bronchial epithelial cells express RANTES. RANTES attracts monocytes, T cells, eosinophils, and basophils; it can also activate eosinophils. To determine whether viral infection induces RANTES expression on bronchial epithelial cells, we infected a bronchial epithelial cell line, NCI-H292, with influenza virus A (H3N2). We then examined the concentration of RANTES in the culture medium of infected cells by ELISA and assessed expression of the gene for RANTES by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We also investigated the concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the medium of infected cells, because some virus infections have been reported to induce expression of these cytokines on bronchial epithelial cells, but there are few data concerning influenza virus infection. Small amounts of IL-6 and IL-8 were detected in the medium of uninfected cells. RANTES was not detected in the medium of uninfected cells. After influenza virus infection, significant amounts of IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES were released into the culture medium of infected cells, and RANTES messenger RNA was detected from infected cells. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was not detected in the medium of uninfected and infected cells. These results suggest that influenza virus infection may stimulate production of IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES from human bronchial epithelial cells and that these cytokines may contribute to the pathogenesis of airway inflammatory diseases caused by influenza virus infection.},

By using spinning disk confocal intravital microscopy, we examined the kinetics and molecular mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment to sites of focal hepatic necrosis in vivo. Adenosine triphosphate released from necrotic cells activated the Nlrp3 inflammasome to generate an inflammatory microenvironment that alerted circulating neutrophils to adhere within liver sinusoids. Subsequently, generation of an intravascular chemokine gradient directed neutrophil migration through healthy tissue toward foci of damage. Lastly, formyl-peptide signals released from necrotic cells guided neutrophils through nonperfused sinusoids into the injury. Thus, dynamic in vivo imaging revealed a multistep hierarchy of directional cues that guide neutrophil localization to sites of sterile inflammation.},

abstract = {Effector T cells significantly contribute to inflammatory diseases. These cells are recruited into tissue, where they orchestrate an inflammatory response that can either protect against infection or sometimes stimulate human disease. The recruitment of T cells into tissue from the blood and lymphoid compartments is an active process controlled by chemokines and the chemokine receptors expressed on distinct effector T-cell subsets. Thus, the chemokines secreted in the tissue will determine the specific types of T lymphocyte recruited into that tissue based on the chemokine receptors expressed on these cells. It follows that the chemokine receptor profile on T cells isolated from the lungs of patients with inflammatory pulmonary disease will define the subtype of pathogenic T lymphocytes mediating the disease process and will identify the mechanisms that recruit these cells into the lung. This article reviews data from both human and animal studies that define the chemokine receptors involved in the recruitment of T lymphocytes into the lung in various inflammatory pulmonary diseases, including asthma, obliterative bronchiolitis, sarcoidosis, and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. We then speculate on the potential role of these chemokine receptors in the pathogenesis of these disorders and potential novel therapeutic approaches suggested by these data.},

abstract = {Seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) continues to be a public health threat. However, we lack a detailed and quantitative understanding of the immune response kinetics to IAV infection and which biological parameters most strongly influence infection outcomes. To address these issues, we use modeling approaches combined with experimental data to quantitatively investigate the innate and adaptive immune responses to primary IAV infection. Mathematical models were developed to describe the dynamic interactions between target (epithelial) cells, influenza virus, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and virus-specific IgG and IgM. IAV and immune kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting models to a large data set obtained from primary H3N2 IAV infection of 340 mice. Prior to a detectable virus-specific immune response (before day 5), the estimated half-life of infected epithelial cells is 1.2 days, and the half-life of free infectious IAV is 4 h. During the adaptive immune response (after day 5), the average half-life of infected epithelial cells is 0.5 days, and the average half-life of free infectious virus is 1.8 min. During the adaptive phase, model fitting confirms that CD8+ CTLs are crucial for limiting infected cells, while virus-specific IgM regulates free IAV levels. This may imply that CD4 T cells and class-switched IgG antibodies are more relevant for generating IAV-specific memory and preventing future infection via a more rapid secondary immune response. Also, simulation studies were performed to understand the relative contributions of biological parameters to IAV clearance. This study provides a basis to better understand and predict influenza virus immunity.},

abstract = {The recirculation of T cells between the blood and secondary lymphoid organs requires that T cells are motile and sensitive to tissue-specific signals. T cell motility has been studied in vitro, but the migratory behavior of individual T cells in vivo has remained enigmatic. Here, using intravital two-photon laser microscopy, we imaged the locomotion and trafficking of naive CD4(+) T cells in the inguinal lymph nodes of anesthetized mice. Intravital recordings deep within the lymph node showed T cells flowing rapidly in the microvasculature and captured individual homing events. Within the diffuse cortex, T cells displayed robust motility with an average velocity of approximately 11 microm x min(-1). T cells cycled between states of low and high motility roughly every 2 min, achieving peak velocities >25 microm x min(-1). An analysis of T cell migration in 3D space revealed a default trafficking program analogous to a random walk. Our results show that naive T cells do not migrate collectively, as they might under the direction of pervasive chemokine gradients. Instead, they appear to migrate as autonomous agents, each cell taking an independent trafficking path. Our results call into question the role of chemokine gradients for basal T cell trafficking within T cell areas and suggest that antigen detection may result from a stochastic process through which a random walk facilitates contact with antigen-presenting dendritic cells.},

abstract = {Adaptive immunity is initiated in secondary lymphoid tissues when naive T cells recognize foreign antigen presented as MHC-bound peptide on the surface of dendritic cells. Only a small fraction of T cells in the naive repertoire will express T cell receptors specific for a given epitope, but antigen recognition triggers T cell activation and proliferation, thus greatly expanding antigen-specific clones. Expanded T cells can serve a helper function for B cell responses or traffic to sites of infection to secrete cytokines or kill infected cells. Over the past decade, two-photon microscopy of lymphoid tissues has shed important light on T cell development, antigen recognition, cell trafficking and effector functions. These data have enabled the development of sophisticated quantitative and computational models that, in turn, have been used to test hypotheses in silico that would otherwise be impossible or difficult to explore experimentally.

In particular, a CCR7 ligand, CCL21, plays important roles in recruiting T cells to secondary lymphoid tissues (SLT). Furthermore, CCL21 together with another CCR7 ligand, CCL19, direct the navigation and compartmentation of T cells within SLT. However, the distinct roles of these two chemokines for regulating cell trafficking and positioning are not clear. In this study, we explore the effect of co-existing CCL19 and CCL21 concentration fields on guiding T cell migration. Using microfluidic devices that can configure single and superimposed chemokine fields we show that under physiological gradient conditions, human peripheral blood T cells chemotax to CCL21 but not CCL19. Furthermore, T cells migrate away from the CCL19 gradient in a uniform background of CCL21. This repulsive migratory response is predicted by mathematical modeling based on the competition of CCL19 and CCL21 for CCR7 signaling and the differential ability of the two chemokines for desensitizing CCR7. These results suggest a new combinatorial guiding mechanism by CCL19 and CCL21 for the migration and trafficking of CCR7 expressing leukocytes.},

Initially the B cells show reduced motility, but after 1 d, motility is increased to approximately 9 $\mu$m/min. Antigen-engaged B cells pair with antigen-specific helper T cells for 10 to more than 60 min, whereas non-antigen-specific interactions last less than 10 min. B cellT cell conjugates are highly dynamic and migrate extensively, being led by B cells. B cells occasionally contact more than one T cell, whereas T cells are strictly monogamous in their interactions. These findings provide evidence of lymphocyte chemotaxis in vivo, and they begin to define the spatiotemporal cellular dynamics associated with T celldependent antibody responses.},

By comparing modeling predictions with both interferon and viral kinetic data, we examined the relative roles of target cell availability, and innate and adaptive immune responses in controlling the virus. Our results show that the rapid and substantial viral decline (about 2 to 4 logs within 1 day) after the peak can be explained by the killing of infected cells mediated by interferon activated cells, such as natural killer cells, during the innate immune response. After the viral load declines to a lower level, the loss of interferon-induced antiviral effect and an increased availability of target cells due to loss of the antiviral state can explain the observed short phase of viral plateau in which the viral level remains unchanged or even experiences a minor second peak in some animals. An adaptive immune response is needed in our model to explain the eventual viral clearance. This study provides a quantitative understanding of the biological factors that can explain the viral and interferon kinetics during a typical influenza virus infection.},

abstract = {It is generally recognized that larger animals eat more, live longer, have larger offspring, and so on; but it is unusual to see these commonplace observations as a basis for scientific biology. A large number of empirically based relationships describe biological rates as simple functions of body size; and other such relations predict the intrinsic rate of population growth, animal speed, animal density, territory size, prey size, physiology, and morphology. Such equations almost always exist for mammals and birds, often for other vertebrates and invertebrates, sometimes for protozoa, algae, and bacteria, and occasionally even for plants. There are too many organisms to measure all aspects of the biology of every species of population, so scientists must depend on generalizations. Body size relations represent our most extensive and powerful assemblage of generalizations, but they have never been organized for use in ecology. This book represents the largest single compilation of interspecific size relations, and instructs the reader on the use of these relationships; their comparison, combination, and criticism. Both strengths and weaknesses of our current knowledge are discussed in order to indicate the many possible directions for further research. This important volume will therefore provide a point of departure toward a new applied ecology, giving quantitative solutions to real questions. It will interest advanced students of ecology and comparative physiology as well as professional biologists.},

abstract = {Mortality from influenza infections continues as a global public health issue, with the host inflammatory response contributing to fatalities related to the primary infection. Based on Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formalism, a computational model was developed for the in-host response to influenza A virus, merging inflammatory, innate, adaptive and humoral responses to virus and linking severity of infection, the inflammatory response, and mortality. The model was calibrated using dense cytokine and cell data from adult BALB/c mice infected with the H1N1 influenza strain A/PR/8/34 in sublethal and lethal doses. Uncertainty in model parameters and disease mechanisms was quantified using Bayesian inference and ensemble model methodology that generates probabilistic predictions of survival, defined as viral clearance and recovery of the respiratory epithelium. The ensemble recovers the expected relationship between magnitude of viral exposure and the duration of survival, and suggests mechanisms primarily responsible for survival, which could guide the development of immuno-modulatory interventions as adjuncts to current anti-viral treatments. The model is employed to extrapolate from available data survival curves for the population and their dependence on initial viral aliquot. In addition, the model allows us to illustrate the positive effect of controlled inflammation on influenza survival.},

The majority of the CD8 T cells in the airways and lung parenchyma expressed CD49a, the alpha-chain of the type IV collagen receptor VLA-1, and these cells were highly activated, producing both IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. In the airways, where type IV collagen is abundant, but not the spleen, the CD49a(+) CD8 cells had reduced proportions of annexin V and caspase 8, and >80\% expressed the TNF-alpha receptor II, while Fas, TNFR-I, and CD27 expression were similar to CD49a(-) cells. Furthermore, the CD49a(+), but not CD49a(-), CD8 T cells from the airways were resistant to active induction of apoptosis in the presence of type IV collagen and TNF-alpha in vitro. We propose that TNFR-II and the VLA-1 synergize to protect effector CD8 T cells in the infected airways from apoptosis during the acute infection.},

abstract = {A key question in pandemic influenza is the relative roles of innate immunity and target cell depletion in limiting primary infection and modulating pathology. Here, we model these interactions using detailed data from equine influenza virus infection, combining viral and immune (type I interferon) kinetics with estimates of cell depletion. The resulting dynamics indicate a powerful role for innate immunity in controlling the rapid peak in virus shedding. As a corollary, cells are much less depleted than suggested by a model of human influenza based only on virus-shedding data. We then explore how differences in the influence of viral proteins on interferon kinetics can account for the observed spectrum of virus shedding, immune response, and influenza pathology. In particular, induction of high levels of interferon ("cytokine storms"), coupled with evasion of its effects, could lead to severe pathology, as hypothesized for some fatal cases of influenza.},

abstract = {To fight infections, rare T cells must quickly home to appropriate lymph nodes (LNs), and reliably localize the antigen (Ag) within them. The first challenge calls for rapid trafficking between LNs, whereas the second may require extensive search within each LN. Here we combine simulations and experimental data to investigate which features of random T cell migration within and between LNs allow meeting these two conflicting demands. Our model indicates that integrating signals from multiple random encounters with Ag-presenting cells permits reliable detection of even low-dose Ag, and predicts a kinetic feature of cognate T cell arrest in LNs that we confirm using intravital two-photon data. Furthermore, we obtain the most reliable retention if T cells transit through LNs stochastically, which may explain the long and widely distributed LN dwell times observed in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that random migration, both between and within LNs, allows recruiting the majority of cognate precursors within a few days for various realistic infection scenarios. Thus, the combination of two-scale stochastic migration and signal integration is an efficient and robust strategy for T cell immune surveillance.},

The relevance of CXCL10 in comparison to CXCL9 in response to genital HSV-2 infection was determined using mice deficient in CXCL9 (CXCL9-/-) and deficient in CXCL10 (CXCL10-/-) along with wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. An increased sensitivity to infection was found in CXCL10-/- mice in comparison to CXCL9-/- or WT mice as determined by detection of HSV-2 in the CNS at day 3 postinfection. However, by day 7 postinfection both CXCL9-/- and CXCL10-/- mice possessed significantly higher viral titers in the CNS in comparison to WT mice consistent with mortality (18-35\%) of these mice within the first 7 days after infection. Even though CXCL9-/- and CXCL10-/- mice expressed elevated levels of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL1 in the spinal cord in comparison to WT mice, there was a reduction in NK cell and virus-specific CD8+ T cell mobilization to this tissue, suggesting CXCL9 and CXCL10 are critical for recruitment of these effector cells to the spinal cord following genital HSV-2 infection. Moreover, leukocytes from the spinal cord but not from draining lymph nodes or spleens of infected CXCL9-/- or CXCL10-/- mice displayed reduced CTL activity in comparison to effector cells from WT mice. Thus, the absence of CXCL9 or CXCL10 expression significantly alters the ability of the host to control genital HSV-2 infection through the mobilization of effector cells to sites of infection.},

Naive, Thy1.2(+)CD8(+) OT-I TCR-Tg cells were primed and recruited to the lung after transfer into congenic Thy1.1(+) recipients challenged with a genetically engineered influenza virus (influenza A/WSN/33 (WSN)-OVA(I)) containing the K(b) restricted OVA(257-264) epitope (siinfekl) in the viral neuraminidase stalk. However, if the transferred animals were infected with a similar influenza virus that expressed an irrelevant K(b) epitope (WSN-PEPII), no TCR-Tg T cells were detectable in the lung, although they were easily visible in the lymphoid organs. Conversely, there were substantial numbers of OT-I cells found in the lungs of WSN-PEPII-infected mice when the animals had been previously, or were concurrently, infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing OVA. Similar results were obtained with nontransgenic populations of memory CD8(+) T cells reactive to a murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 Ag. Interestingly, the primary host response to the immunodominant influenza nucleoprotein epitope was not affected by the presence of memory or recently activated OT-I T cells. Thus, although Ag is required to activate the T cells, the subsequent localization of T cells to the lung during a virus infection is a property of recently activated and memory T cells and is not necessarily driven by Ag in the lung.},

abstract = {In many immunological processes chemoattraction is thought to play a role in guiding cells to their sites of action. However, based on in vivo two-photon microscopy experiments in the absence of cognate antigen, T cell migration in lymph nodes (LNs) has been roughly described as a random walk. Although it has been shown that dendritic cells (DCs) carrying cognate antigen in some circumstances attract T cells chemotactically, it is currently still unclear whether chemoattraction of T cells towards DCs helps or hampers scanning. Chemoattraction towards DCs could on the one hand help T cells to rapidly find DCs. On the other hand, it could be deleterious if DCs become shielded by a multitude of attracted yet non-specific T cells. Results from a recent simulation study suggested that the deleterious effect dominates. We re-addressed the question whether T cell chemoattraction towards DCs is expected to promote or hamper the detection of rare antigens using the Cellular Potts Model, a formalism that allows for dynamic, flexible cellular shapes and cell migration. Our simulations show that chemoattraction of T cells enhances the DC scanning efficiency, leading to an increased probability that rare antigen-specific T cells find DCs carrying cognate antigen. Desensitization of T cells after contact with a DC further improves the scanning efficiency, yielding an almost threefold enhancement compared to random migration. Moreover, the chemotaxis-driven migration still roughly appears as a random walk, hence fine-tuned analysis of cell tracks will be required to detect chemotaxis within microscopy data.},

To understand the development of the cell-mediated immune response to influenza and how leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation is regulated, we examined the chemokine expression pattern in lung tissue from A/PR/8/34-infected C57BL/6 mice using an RNase protection assay. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, MIP-3alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), MIP-2, and interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) mRNA expression was up-regulated between days 5 and 15 after infection, consistent with a role for these chemokines in leukocyte recruitment to the lung. Low levels of expression were detected for the CC chemokine receptors (CCR)2 and CCR5, whereas CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)3 was significantly up-regulated by day 10 after infection, coinciding with peak inflammatory cell infiltration in the airways. As RANTES, IP-10, and their receptors were up-regulated during influenza virus infection, we investigated leukocyte recruitment and viral clearance in mice deficient in RANTES or CXCR3, the receptor for IP-10. Leukocyte recruitment and viral replication in influenza-infected RANTES knockout(-/-) mice were similar to that in control mice, showing that RANTES is not essential for the immune response to influenza infection. Similarly, leukocyte recruitment and viral replication in CXCR3-/- mice were identical to control mice, except at day 8 postinfection, where fewer lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage of CXCR3-/- mice. These studies suggest that although the chemokines detected may play a role in regulating leukocyte trafficking to the lung during influenza infection, some may be functionally redundant.},

abstract = {Influenza is caused by a virus that attacks mainly the upper respiratory tract the nose, throat and bronchi and rarely also the lungs. The infection usually lasts for about a week. It is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, myalgia, headache and severe malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis. Most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment. In the very young, the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases, diabetes, cancer, kidney or heart problems, influenza poses a serious risk. In these people, the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases, pneumonia and death. Influenza rapidly spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics and imposes a considerable economic burden in the form of hospital and other health care costs and lost productivity. In the United States of America, for example, recent estimates put the cost of influenza epidemics to the economy at US 71-167 billion per year. In annual influenza epidemics 5-15\% of the population are affected with upper respiratory tract infections. Hospitalization and deaths mainly occur in high-risk groups (elderly, chronically ill). Although difficult to assess, these annual epidemics are thought to result in between three and five million cases of severe illness and between 250 000 and 500 000 deaths every year around the world. Most deaths currently associated with influenza in industrialized countries occur among the elderly over 65 years of age. Much less is known about the impact of influenza in the developing world. However, influenza outbreaks in the tropics where viral transmission normally continues year-round tend to have high attack and case-fatality rates. For example, during an influenza outbreak in Madagascar in 2002, more than 27 000 cases were reported within three months and 800 deaths occurred despite rapid intervention. An investigation of this outbreak, coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO), found that there were severe health consequences in poorly nourished populations with limited access to adequate health care (see Outbreak of influenza, Madagascar, July-August 2002,Weekly Epidemiological Record,). It is not possible to extrapolate the exact annual burden of influenza in the tropics from data from such occasional and severe outbreaks.},

The importance of this chemokine to the control of HSV-1 infection was tested using mice deficient in CXCL10 (CXCL10(-/-)). Following corneal infection, HSV-1 viral titers were elevated in the nervous system of CXCL10(-/-) mice, which correlated with defects in leukocyte recruitment including dendritic cells, NK cells, and HSV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells to the brain stem. In the absence of NK cells and HSV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells in wild-type (WT) or CXCL10(-/-) mice, similar levels of virus were recovered in the nervous system, suggesting these cells are responsible for the observed defects in the control of viral replication in CXCL10(-/-) mice. Leukocyte mobilization was also compared between WT, CXCL10(-/-), and mice deficient in the only known receptor for CXCL10, CXCR3 (CXCR3 (-/-)). NK cell mobilization was comparably reduced in both CXCL10(-/-) and CXCR3(-/-) mice relative to WT animals. However, the reduction in mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells in CXCL10(-/-) was not observed in CXCR3(-/-) mice following HSV-1 infection. The defect was not the result of an alternative receptor for CXCL10, as Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell recruitment was not reduced in mice which were deficient in both CXCL10 and CXCR3. Thus, CXCL10 deficiency results in reduced mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells as a result of dysregulation of CXCR3 signaling.},

Using this model, we compared the abilities of selected 2004 HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from humans and a recent human H3N2 virus to trigger the type I interferon (IFN) response. H5N1 viruses elicited significantly less IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) nuclear translocation, as well as delayed and reduced production of IFN-beta compared with the H3N2 virus. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Stat2 and induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as MX1, ISG15, IRF7, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I, were substantially delayed and reduced in cells infected with H5N1 viruses. We also observed that the highly virulent H5N1 virus replicated more efficiently and induced a weaker IFN response than the H5N1 virus that exhibited low virulence in mammals in an earlier study. Our data suggest that the H5N1 viruses tested, especially the virus with the high-pathogenicity phenotype, possess greater capability to attenuate the type I IFN response than the human H3N2 virus. The attenuation of this critical host innate immune defense may contribute to the virulence of H5N1 viruses observed in humans.},

abstract = {The pandemic H1N1 virus of 2009 (2009 H1N1) produced a spectrum of disease ranging from mild illness to severe illness and death. Respiratory symptoms were frequently associated with virus infection, with relatively high rate of gastrointestinal symptoms reported. To better understand 2009 H1N1 virus pathogenesis in humans, we studied virus and host responses following infection of two cell types: polarized bronchial and pharyngeal epithelial cells, which exhibit many features of the human airway epithelium, and colon epithelial cells to serve as a human intestinal cell model. Selected 2009 H1N1 viruses were compared to both seasonal H1N1 and triple-reassortant swine H1N1 influenza viruses that have circulated among North American pigs since before the 2009 pandemic. All H1N1 viruses replicated productively in airway cells; however, in contrast to seasonal H1N1 virus infection, infection with the 2009 H1N1 and triple-reassortant swine H1N1 viruses resulted in an attenuated inflammatory response, a weaker interferon response, and reduced cell death. Additionally, the H1N1 viruses of swine origin replicated less efficiently at the temperature of the human proximal airways (33C). We also observed that the 2009 H1N1 viruses replicated to significantly higher titers than seasonal H1N1 virus in polarized colon epithelial cells. These studies reveal that in comparison to seasonal influenza virus, H1N1 viruses of swine origin poorly activate multiple aspects of the human innate response, which may contribute to the virulence of these viruses. In addition, their less efficient replication at human upper airway temperatures has implications for the understanding of pandemic H1N1 virus adaptation to humans.},

abstract = {CD8+ T lymphocyte responses are a critical arm of the immune response to respiratory virus infection and may play a role in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease. We have shown that CD8+ T cells induce significant lung injury in the absence of virus infection by adoptive transfer into mice with alveolar expression of a viral transgene. The injury is characterized by the parenchymal infiltration of host cells, primarily macrophages, which correlates with physiologic deficits in transgenic animals. CD8+ T cellmediated lung injury can occur in the absence of perforin and Fas expression as long as TNF-$\alpha$ is available. Here, we show that the effect of TNF-$\alpha$ expressed by CD8+ T cells is mediated not exclusively by cytotoxicity, but also through the activation of alveolar target cells and their expression of inflammatory mediators. CD8+ T cell recognition of alveolar cells in vitro triggered monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) expression in the targets, which was mediated by TNF-$\alpha$. Antigen-dependent alveolar MCP-1 expression was observed in vivo as early as 3 hours after CD8+ T cell transfer and depended upon TNF-R1 expression in transgenic recipients. MCP-1 neutralization significantly reduced parenchymal infiltration after T cell transfer. We conclude that alveolar epithelial cells actively participate in the inflammation and lung injury associated with CD8+ T cell recognition of alveolar antigens.

abstract = {T lymphocytes (T cells) express T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules on their surface that can recognize peptides (p) derived from antigenic proteins bound to products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The pMHC molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). T cells first encounter antigen on DCs in lymph nodes (LN). Intravital microscopy experiments show that upon entering the LN containing antigen, CD8+ T cells first move rapidly. After a few hours, they stop and make extended contacts with DCs. The factors that determine when and how this transition occurs are not well understood. We report results from computer simulations that suggest that the duration of phase one is related to the low probability of productive interactions between T cells and DCs. This is demonstrated by our finding that the antigen dose and type determine when such a transition occurs. These results are in agreement with experimental observations. TCR-pMHC binding characteristics and the antigen dose determine the time required for a productive T-cell-DC encounter (resulting in sustained contact). We find that the ratio of this time scale and the half-life of the pMHC complex itself provide a consolidated measure of antigen quantity and type. Results obtained upon varying different measures of antigen quantity and type fall on one curve when graphed against this ratio of time scales. Thus, we provide a mechanism for how the effects of varying one set of parameters are influenced by other prevailing conditions. This understanding should help guide future experimentation.},

  Spatially explicit model of the lymphocyte diaspora in influenza-
infected lung quantifies constraints of chemokine directed migration

---------------------
RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
---------------------

--- Reviewer #1 ---

1) The title may be misleading as the model is very simplified from the 
immunological viewpoint and gives rather a qualitative rather than a
quantitative view of the spatial dynamics.

- We have changed the title by removing the words 'quantifies constraints'
and have replaced them with 'reveals thresholds' which we believe more
accurately reflects the paper's main focus. 


2) Introduction, p3: It would be interesting to add a general reference to 
agent-based models (ABM), in particular spatial ABM in immunology and briefly
justify the use of an ABM rather than partial differential equations in the
present context.

- Added reference to Beauchemin 2006 paper that discusses ABM advantages vs.
differential equations as well as Bauer 2009.  The last scentence in the
paragraph has been rewritten for clarity.


3) Computational modelling section: there is no reference to Fig. 1 in the 
main text. As far as I understand the drawing in Fig. 1, I see 16 branches 
rather than 14, why?

- A reference to Fig. 1 has been added to the Model section.  The number 14
refers to the depth of the bronchial tree, where each layer represents the
bifurcation of a branch.  Thus, each level results in the doubling of the total
number of pathways.  14 branches refers to 2^14 = 16,384 endpoints.  The
figure simplifies this to 4 layers and thus 2^4 = 16 endpoints.  The figure
has been edited to read '14 bifurcations' rather than '14 branches' and the
caption has been changed to read 'vascular bifurcations' for clarity.


4) Acronyms in text and tables should be defined (for example, ODE, FOI, NHBE,
ATC, ?).

- Acronyms in the text have been either defined or removed.  Acronyms in 
Table 1 have been defined in the caption.


5) Model definition:
   - More details concerning the implementation of the ABM need to be given,
       at least in the supplement: a short description of the spatial 
       arrangement (size of the simulation space, cell arrangement, number of
       epithelial cells, as well as how T cell movement vs. particle diffusion
       has been implemented.
   - IgM addition is mentioned in section 2.1 of the supplement but not 
       indicated in the main text.
   - What happens in this ABM when a free virus particle infects a cell: is it
       absorbed and does it disappear from the pool of free viruses?

- Two new sections were added to the supplement.  One describing details of the
general CyCells model environment and one describing details of the model 
specific to this paper.  These sections address all the points raised here
aside from IgM.
  -Added a sentence referencing the IgM implementation to the main paper.


6) Materials, p6: the sentence "treatment of the monolayer with protease" is
not understandable without reading reference [19] and requires here more
explanation.

- TODO: Fred


7) Chemokine production, p6:
   - The definition of all the variables and parameters of the ODE model in 
       the supplement (eqs S1) should be added in order to be more self-
       contained.
   - Fig. 3: "> 8500 pg/mL" is indicated as a measurement threshold for sH1N1.
       Why is this not also the case for aH5N1 and pH1N1?

- The main differential equation has been moved to the beginning of the model
section of the main paper.
- TODO: Fred - 8,500 limit description


8) T cell sensitivity, p7, top: The sentence "Because multiple T cells ? we 
hypothesize ? more T cells are not more efficient above a critical threshold"
is unclear. Is it not that the probability of apoptosis induction will increase
with the T cell number even if the rate of transition from secreting to
apoptotic cells does not scale with T cell number?

- It is NOT that the probability would increase with additional T cells at the
infected epithelial cell in our model.  The section has been rearranged. The
detail regarding multiple T cells has been moved to other sections to be more
clear.  We have also added two expanded model description sections to the 
supplement that we hope clarifies this point.


9) Spatial effects:
   - p7, bottom: refer also to Fig. S1
   - Figure 6, legend: Can the difference in behaviour for pH1N1 and sH1N1 
       infections not be explained by the difference in IP-10 production rates
       (even if small)?

- Reference to Fig. S1 was added.
- We performed a new model run combining pH1N1 virus and sH1N1 chemokine and found no
difference in the infection profile.  A sentence was added to the end of the
Fig. 6 caption reflecting this.


10) Discussion, p10, 2d ยง: reference should also be given to section 2.2 of the
supplement where combinations of chemokines are considered.

- Reference added.


11) Eqs S1: add definition of variables and parameters
    - Eqs S2: add definition of t_rc and v_tcell; reference to Fig. 1 of the 
        main text should also be given in section 1.2 of the supplement as eqs.
        S2 relate to the bottom part of this figure.
    - Section 2.2: does the conclusion that RANTES does not play a significant 
        role for H1N1 infections not simply follows from the fact that IP-10 
        has a much higher production rate (about 100 times) than RANTES in the
        H1N1 strains (Table 2, main text)?

- We have moved the first equation from the supplement to the main paper to 
help address the point that the paper is not self-contained.  We have added
a new table with descriptions and values for each population and parameter
of this equation.
  - Done
  - Indeed, it does follow given the assumption that T cells are equally
  sensitive to each chemokine.  The text in S2.2 has been modified to make
  that assumption clear and to strengthen the conclusion.


12) Minor points:
    - p7, Fig. 5, top row: T cells are barely visible. Could this be improved?
    - p7, Fig. 6, legend, 5th line:  add "more expressing cells than sH1N1".
    - p8, line 4: taking the viral production indicated in Table 2, I find 2632
        rather than 2643
    - p9, line 12 from bottom: greater ? than
    - p9, line 3 from bottom: replace "into" by "in"
    - Note that some Table and reference numbers have been replaced by question
        marks in the supplement

- The figure has been artificially enhanced to improve visibility and a note 
    regarding the change has been added to the caption.
- Done
- This was calculated before we rounded to significant digits.  Fixed.
    (Impressive eye for detail!)
- This sentence has been removed.
- Done
- Fixed

A spatial agent-based model examines T cell search in an influenza infected lung.

Experimental data show chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5 are stimulated by infection.

Rapidly expanding plaques of infection create challenges for chemotaxing T cells.

Sensitivity analysis isolates the effects of each parameter in the model.

Model parameters are used to determine an upper bound on T cell search time.
